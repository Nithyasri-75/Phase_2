Productivity,UnderstandingFew2905,"i feel like ali abdaal turned productivity into an aesthetic, not a mindset","no hate to ali, dude’s smart, great camera presence, and clearly knows his stuff.

but can we talk about how his content (and the clones it spawned) kind of turned “productivity” into this perfectly lit, mic’d up, clickbaity lifestyle?

like:

* do i *really* need a $300 keyboard and a $40 journaling system to get sh\*t done?
* are we optimizing workflows, or just creating prettier ways to procrastinate?
* how many second brains do we need before we actually do the work?

it’s not just him either, the whole productivity yt/influencer scene feels like it’s optimized *for itself*. like being productive became a performance.

and the irony is... watching hours of these videos kind of kills your actual productivity.

Productivity,Cautious-Wonder6376,Does anyone else feel like their to-do list is just a guilt trip?,"I used to think a to-do list would help me stay organized and focused. But lately, it’s just felt like this giant guilt scroll I check every morning. I’d open it up and see everything likeclient emails, scheduling, bookkeeping, groceries, text Mom back, fix the leaky faucet. Business stuff, personal life stuff, all mashed together like I’m supposed to magically have time for it all.  
  
Running a small business solo is already draining. You wear every hat CEO, assistant, tech support, therapist and the to-do list doesn’t care. It just keeps stacking. And when I’d look at it at the end of the day, barely anything was crossed off. It didn’t make me feel accomplished; it made me feel like I was constantly behind on everything.  
  
Lately, I’ve realized that trying to be productive in every single area of life is what’s actually burning me out. So I’ve started setting some boundaries, no more work after hours, fewer meetings just for the sake of it, and I brought on a virtual assistant to help with the admin side of things. Not gonna pretend it solved everything overnight, but even small changes like those have given me more breathing room. I'm finally finding moments to just honestly, lay back.  
  
Now when I check my to-do list, it doesn’t make me sigh. It feels a little more manageable. A little more human. Still far from perfect, but at least it’s no longer a reminder of everything I couldn’t get done.  
  
Lately, we’ve even been tossing around the idea of getting rid of the to-do list altogether, but then what? How do you keep track of stuff without falling into chaos?

Productivity,Substantial__dean,Cut my daily productivity tools down to 4 - here’s what actually stuck,"I’m in sales, and I meet with clients pretty much every day - discovery calls, demos, follow-ups, you name it. It’s a lot of conversations, a lot of promises made, and even more things to keep track of. For a while, I was juggling way too many tools just trying to stay organized, and honestly, it was making things worse.

So I made it a goal to reduce the number of apps I use daily. Less context switching, fewer tabs, more clarity. After experimenting with a bunch of setups, here’s the 4-app workflow that’s actually stuck and helps me stay on top of my game:

* **Sunsama** (Minimal Calendar App) - I use Sunsama to plan my day and manage client meetings. It’s got a super clean UI, and I like that it keeps my work calendar separate from personal stuff. No distractions, no shared family events popping up mid-call - just a focused schedule.
* **Tablo** (AI Meeting Notes) - This one’s the MVP. Tablo transcribes all my client meetings live, gives me a clean summary, and even auto-generates todos. I used to forget follow-ups or misplace notes all the time. Now I just open Tablo after a meeting and everything’s there. The todo feature(in one app!) is a literal lifesaver.
* **Wave** (Invoice and Payment) - I use Wave to send invoices and get payments from my clients. It’s free, looks professional, and handles the stuff I’d rather not think about. Way better than chasing down payments manually or fiddling with clunky spreadsheets.
* **Claude AI** \- After meetings, I’ll use Claude(not ChatGPT I know) to help write follow-up emails based on the Tablo summary. It’s saved me from a lot of “just circling back” emails and made my replies sound more human (without me having to think too hard about it).

Hope this helps other folks out there who are also in sales and trying to keep their workflow clean and focused.",https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1l9ky5g/cut_my_daily_productivity_tools_down_to_4_heres/,12-06-2025

I was wondering if anyone has a good offline email client that works well with gmail? I like to clear my email but I do not want to delete it and as I understand, thunderbird for example only does delete, not archive. Thunderbird is also annoying as it does not seem to register people I have emailed in the past so I have to remember their email verbatim or send it later but that kinda loses  bit the point of offline email and clearing the inbox.

Also, gmail supports offline mode but in my experience so far, it has been very very unstable, to the point of unusable. Google sheets is a lot better.

So far for me, only onenote is the only real productivity thing on windows (and gmail on android) that works well offline except any specialised software.

Productivity,Marvellover13,Is there an app that can help me track time spent in the day?,"Currently I'm using notes and I do the following:
Woke up at 9:00
Morning routine until 9:25
News until 9:40
Assignment #12 until 11:20

This doesn't work well as I write from right to left and the notes app is kinda funky with it, and also it makes me spend some time on calculating all these times.

And then at the end of the day I try to separate all of these times (by taking the difference) into a few categories like: essential daily routine (things I can't go without like lunch/dinner, morning routine, shower), study time, breaks and fun (for breaks and for whatever like, anime, video games...) and I also have the category of workout and on rare occasions an outing.

An ideal app would let me input the time I woke up, and would allow me to create these categories on the fly and keep everything in check, and at the end of the day will tell me how much hours were today and show in a pi graph how it was spent, and you can extend this to weeks and months as well.

Productivity,asta_la,I am so busy and defeated I don’t know how to cope or be productive,"
I am so incredibly busy I feel like I don’t even have a life and can’t get anything done. I work 12 hour weekend shifts at the hospital Friday, Saturday Sunday 7 AM to 7 PM and in between the first two shifts I have to sleep at the hospital on call. So after every day of work on the weekend, I have nothing better to do then go to bed or scroll on my phone. I get home Sunday night after 8 PM. Take a shower then lay down and go to bed then Monday I can finally sleep in and I have to leave for school at 3 PM. I then go to school from 5 to 9 PM then usually have to visit with my family for the week after and by the time I get home it’s midnight and I go straight to bed. Tuesday is my one day off, but all I been doing is dreading having to wake up early in the next morning and doing all housework and chores for the week. On Wednesday I have a clinical for school, which is from 7 AM to 4 PM so once I get home around 5 PM after being up since 5 AM, all I do is lay in bed. then the next day on Thursday, I wake up at 5 AM and go to a clinical from 7 AM to 4 PM again then go to school from 5 PM to 9 PM then get home around midnight again and go to bed to wake up at 5 AM to drive to work and stay there for the weekend.

I have been in school for a year and only have one year left and I know this won’t last forever but right now it feels completely impossible and I am so depressed and dreadful of every single day. I don’t have any good days anymore. I live so far away from school and work and have to commute multiple hours a day and on top of my regular work. I also have to do 2 9 hour clinicals a week where I don’t get paid. there is absolutely nothing. I can do to save myself any more time I can’t do less work. I can’t do less school and I am so exhausted now I only see my family for an hour or two every week and the only friend I see is when I go to school. I don’t have time for hobbies anymore and anything productive that I do when I am off just feels like a waste of my time off because all I want to do when I’m busy is lay in bed and do nothing. 

I just feel so defeated and I don’t know how to cope with this. I know it will only last for another year, but this year is going to feel like eternity I literally feel like I am in hell. I also have a lot of resentment towards everyone in my life in someway or another is not as busy as me and complains about it like the girls in school who don’t have a full-time job or the people at work who don’t go to school full-time. it just doesn’t feel fair.

Productivity,zacharier_18,Monitoring social media usage motivated me to save nearly 10 hours a week.,"With a lot of things in life, we often feel more motivated when results lead to achievements. Using my phone's weekly notification on my screen time and social media usage gave me a small sense of achievement and motivated me at most for a few days of the new week before I fell back into the social media trap. 

Knowing that visualizing my social media usage motivates me to scroll less, I decided to find an app that will allow me to easily view my usage stats. I came across an app that I use daily now which sends me notifications at 7 am everyday with yesterday's usage time, reminding me of my goal for the day. 

I was also able to visualize my usage on a chart and saw that I was saving nearly 1.5 hours every day (from \~2 hrs/day to 10-20 minutes). The app counts any social media usage so even if i'm just messaging my friends, i'm gaining usage time. 

I noticed that I started using regular messaging apps which also helped with not falling into the scrolling habit and wasting time.

Productivity,Luvisdeww,I Tested 50+ Productivity Apps – Here’s My Final Stack,"I’ve finally found my productivity stack that works for me after spending a considerable amount of time trying virtually everything available.

1. **NotePlan**

I absolutely love NotePlan and how it seamlessly integrates markdown notes for GTD with calendar functionality. It just makes sense to me, even though there’s a slight learning curve initially.

2. **Todoist**

While NotePlan is excellent for task input, I find Todoist much faster and more intuitive for quickly entering and categorizing tasks with its smart language input feature. NotePlan also has a plugin for Todoist integration with one-way sync from Todoist to NotePlan. Additionally, I find the interface much more satisfying and minimalist compared to other apps like TickTick, which has many features but a somewhat chaotic and overwhelming UI/UX. Todoist feels crafted with care while TickTick feels robotic. I can’t quite explain it, but it just makes sense to me.

3. **Bear**

Although NotePlan is also excellent for general note-taking, I find Bear superior as a notes app when I know I’ll be capturing extensive information, such as course notes or reading notes. The application is also beautifully designed, and I was looking for a way to integrate it into my workflow. So I use NotePlan for daily planning and journaling notes, while Bear handles my miscellaneous notes.

Productivity,WhalePlaying,Efficient formats editing bilingual docs,"

I’m keeping a lot of translation notes. Just wondering how you prefer your bilingual docs (or simply two versions) to be merged/compiled in an efficient way?

Methods tried: Using a table with 2 columns, each column represents a language, insert each sentence or paragraph in each row. Easier when you just want to copy and paste a language, can a little difficult to read long paragraph. 

Using apps with outliner function, under the tree of book structure, insert bullet point for each language. Easier to read and to expand or collapse a whole chapter, difficult to single out 1 language. 

(Written or printed on paper) Language A on the left-hand page, language B on the right-hand page. Can be achieved connecting text boxes

Using language A as main text, adding footnotes as language B …

I really struggle with getting up early because I just seem to use that time to take longer to get ready and then i never feel it benefits me.

Productivity,Goldio_Inc,From 8 hours to 30 minutes - how I finally broke my phone addiction,"I'm honestly ashamed to write this… but my screen time was averaging 8 hours a day (mostly social media videos)… it was completely destroying my focus and relationships.

The scary part is how it just sneaks up on you…

**Morning:** scroll in bed (1.5+ hrs)  
**Coffee/meals:** always with my phone (45+ mins)  
**After work:** ""quick check"" that turns into hours (2.5 hrs)  
**Before bed:** ""just 10 minutes"" becomes 2+ hours  
**Middle of the night:** when I can't sleep, more scrolling (1+ hr)  
**Random throughout the day:** (1.5 hrs)

I finally hit my breaking point when I realized I'd spent an entire Saturday just… scrolling. Like literally the whole day was gone.

So I went nuclear and tried a bunch of strategies I found here on reddit...

**1) Phone goes to grayscale after 6pm**  
I absolutely hate how it looks… which is exactly the point. Everything becomes so much less appealing when it's not designed to hijack your brain with colors and notifications.

**2) Complete social media blackout from 9pm to 9am**  
Those late night and early morning sessions were the worst for my mental health. I felt like garbage every single time. Now I can still watch Netflix at night, but at least I'm actually watching instead of splitting my attention.

**3) Earned screen time blockers (this one's brutal but works)**  
Yeah, screen time blockers. Everyone talks about them because they actually work. Doesn't matter which app you use. I set mine to block everything and you have to earn screen time throughout the day. I made it ridiculously hard on myself... 30 minute workout only gets me 5 minutes of screen time. It sounds extreme but it completely flipped my relationship with my phone.

**4) Actually replace the habit with stuff I enjoy**  
This was huge. You can't just remove something without filling the void.

I had a stack of books I bought months ago just sitting there, so now I keep one with me for those random 5-minute gaps.

My keyboard was literally gathering dust in the corner. Now I mess around with it for 20-30 minutes most days and it's honestly more satisfying than any video I've ever watched.

I've been texting old friends I'd been meaning to reach out to but never did because I was too busy being ""busy"" on my phone.

And I'm actually learning Spanish (slowly) instead of just saving ""learn Spanish"" videos that I never watch again.

**The results are honestly wild.** I have so much more mental energy. I'm not constantly anxious about missing something. And I'm actually doing things I've been saying I wanted to do for years.

Still not perfect, but going from 8 hours to 90 minutes feels like getting my life back.",https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1l80qgv/from_8_hours_to_30_minutes_how_i_finally_broke_my/,10-06-2025

Productivity,FrankPvS,"Feeling exhausted, how can I get back on track?","Hi, M25 here. I'm writing this to seek some advice.

I'm in med school, and I should graduate in about 1.5 years. I think I'm burned out.  
I have to take two huge exams in 14 days. For the past few weeks, all I've been doing is studying and working out, and still, I don't think my preparation will be good enough. I honestly feel hopeless and drained.

I've been sleeping 8 hours a night, but I wake up 2 or 3 times, probably because of anxiety. And when I wake up in the morning, I already feel down, knowing I'll have to study all day just to maybe be prepared in time for the exams.  
Today, I started studying, but I felt like I couldn’t remember anything I’d read just five minutes before. I think I’ve reached a point of exhaustion.

I feel a lot of pressure not to let my grades fall, partly because of ego, but also because my grades will affect my chances of getting into the specialty I want (which is one of the hardest to get into).  
At the same time, I could take my time and postpone these exams, but I feel like that would mean falling behind my peers.

To make things worse, the two exams I have to take are on subjects I don’t enjoy and that aren’t even closely related to the field I want to pursue. On top of that, my professors are extremely demanding. We’re expected to memorize tons of classification criteria and cutoffs, most of which we’ll forget a week later anyway.

I’ve tried distracting myself, but I always end up thinking about those two exams and how I need to use every minute if I want to have a chance of learning everything in time.

So yeah, I hope someone who's been through something similar can offer some advice.

I've tried Notion but the fact that everything is stored on their cloud is a deal breaker for me. I want (1) the option to store everything on the computer I paid for and (2) if the company developing the app were to shut down tomorrow then nothing on my end would be impacted besides continual updates. In other words I would be able to use the app at least temporarily.

I tried Obsidian but it's too ""techy"" if that makes sense. I know absolutely no markdown and no code with no desire to learn any. It's also extremely barebones without any set-up. I may as well just write notepad files on my computer.

I additionally tried OneNote, but like everything Microsoft does I found it to be too bloated. Also, there's literally a Microsoft 365 advertisement in the top right corner. No thanks. Besides, OneNote tried saving everything to OneDrive and I couldn't figure out how to make it stop using the cloud storage.

The only app I have found that I enjoyed thus far is Scrivener. It's primarily used for novel writing but while on my free trial I used the app for everything. It's great for organization. I would use Scrivener but I wanted to hear some other options if there are to be any.

Unfortunately, Scrivener is only supported on Windows and MacOS, and I am a Linux user. I am looking into running Scrivener on Wine (a program that allows Windows apps to be run on Linux) but results tend to be mixed. I will need an alternative to Scrivener if I am unable to properly run the app on Wine. Or, if I am desperate I suppose I can run Windows virtually within Linux with the sole purpose of using Scrivener.

* Business planning & milestone tracking
* Research & light coding
* Using on-the-go, including at the gym or while commuting

* Is the 13"" too bulky to carry everywhere? Or is the screen size worth it for productivity?
* Any issues with portability for daily use? I have been leaning towards 11"" because I want something that I can bring EVERYWHERE without having second thoughts.

I’m hoping that maybe one does exist already that I somehow haven’t seen or been able to make the best use of. I can list what I’m looking for, what I don’t need & what I’ve tried.

Use Case:
A lot of my current job is onboarding people for positions and verifying compliance. The task for the position remains the same, however, it can vary by where they will be working at. Example - I have location 1, location 2 & location 3. Each location will have different tasks to onboard for the person. I constantly have people in the queue and the start dates don’t necessarily matter as much because it depends on many of the tasks and how quickly they are completed. I also have some documents that are required to be submitted. There are some steps that cannot happen until other steps happen. 

Needs
- Task Management
- Templates (because the task for each location remains the same)
- Task Grouping (so if I have 3 people on step 2 at location 3, I would like to complete all of those tasks together.)

Nice to have 
- Dependencies (so task 3 doesn’t show up on my list for the person before task 2)
- Notes section? (example: Somewhere to keep track of information gained in step 1 that I will need in step 4)

Do not need
- collaboration / team environment (this will be my personal task/project management system)
- Reminders or notifications
- email / calendar connections
- integrations
- mobile access

App History - 
I do pay for todoist, but it doesn’t have the template option and task grouping I am looking for. I do use that for other tasks though that aren’t in the routine type system.

I’ve tried:
Clickup
Airtable
SmartSuite
Notion

Set up when it’s a personal app is pretty difficult, honestly. I also do not want or plan to pay someone to set this up for me. I would honestly prefer a free plan, if possible. I’m open to circling back to an app I’ve tried if there is a better way to use it. I’ve tried looking up PM templates, but they weigh heavy on dates and timelines. HR Onboarding templates are more so about hiring for positions, not tasks after acceptance.

If there is a different way I should be searching for templates, I’d love to hear that as well.

I'll sit at my desk planning to get things done, and end up just staring at my phone for hours.

At first, I thought I was just being lazy, but my sister pointed out that maybe the real problem is my room environment. This room hasn't changed in three years — still using that too-small desk from college, that terrible chair, everything remains exactly the same.

* Getting a standing desk (my back is killing me from hunching over)
* Replacing my couch with one that isn't covered in coffee stains
* Installing decent lighting instead of this depressing lamp I have now

But I don't want to throw money at this if it's not actually going to help, you know? Has anyone here actually found that changing your physical space made a difference in how you work? Or is this just me trying to buy my way out of a motivation problem?

# Extension Hell

* **Zero extensions work properly** \- not a single one functions as expected
* **Can't install extensions from Chrome Web Store** \- what's the point of Chromium-based if this doesn't work?
* **App Store extensions aren't detected** \- I have extensions installed from the Mac App Store, but SigmaOS acts like they don't exist
* **Only pre-installed extensions are ""acceptable""** \- and even those are buggy

The extensions I need are literally available in the App Store. How is making extensions work not a basic feature in 2025?

# Passkey/Authentication Nightmare

* **No passkey support with iCloud Keychain** \- seriously?
* **Bitwarden integration is broken** \- my passkeys are stored there but the browser can't detect them
* **Built-in password manager is trash** \- unreliable and missing basic features

# Basic Navigation Issues

* **No tab switching shortcuts** \- Control+Tab doesn't work
* **Command+numbers (Cmd+1,2,3...) don't work** \- these are standard browser shortcuts that every other browser supports

# The Irony

For a browser that markets itself as ""productive,"" it's missing the most basic productivity features that every other browser has had for years. I spend more time fighting the browser than actually being productive.

**Has anyone else experienced these issues? Are there workarounds, or should I just switch back to Safari/Chrome/Firefox?**

Productivity,Yone0908,I tracked every phone call interruption for 30 days. The data is insane.,"I got obsessed with figuring out why I couldn't focus, so I logged every single phone call for a month. Every. Single. One.

**The setup:** Logged time, duration, type, and how long it took to refocus after. Used a basic spreadsheet + timer.

**The data that broke me:**

* 186 calls total (6.2 per day)
* 68% were spam/robocalls
* Average refocus time: 4.7 minutes (even for ignored calls)
* **Total productivity loss: 23 minutes/day**

**The wild patterns:**

* Spam calls spike at 10:17am and 2:43pm (literally during my best focus hours)
* ""Important"" unknown numbers I stressed about? 4% were actually important
* Ignoring calls created more distraction than answering (anxiety about missing something)

**What actually worked:**

* Airplane mode: Killed productivity anxiety about missing important stuff
* Scheduled call windows: Nobody respected them

**The mindblowing stat:** We're collectively losing 6.5 billion hours/year to spam calls. 

Started building something to fix this for myself - basically an AI that can tell the difference between spam patterns and real calls. Happy to share if anyone else is drowning in this problem too.

Productivity,Equivalent-Ferret146,Does productivity inherently need 'a sterilized room of one's own'?,"Hi everyone, I'm fairly new to this subreddit so please be nice to me :)



Recently I've been wondering how to be the type of person who, when given an assignment or task, immediately jumps at the opportunity and gets it done on the spot and doesn't give up when trying to learn something. And a friend told me that when trying to do any sort of work, the pomodoro technique is the best possible tool to use to do so. And so I figured 'eh, why not'? But five minutes seemed like a very small break to me and so I googled 'things to do during a pomodoro break'. I ended up finding a post here that said the best thing to do would be nothing because that will actually give you the motivation to do your work because the alternative seems so unappealing by contrast. And that got me thinking, is it possible to do any sort of deep work in this day and age when there's something to occupy at every turn?



I imagine that you might be thinking 'duh, obviously!' and that's obviously fine but bear with me for a minute. My job (I'm a content writer for a fashion magazine) inherently requires me to be on the internet (to research any trends, find images, etc) the whole day, and as a result even though I've blocked Y outube, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook (pretty much all the time occupying social media sites), I still find myself completely and utterly distracted by random things like books, news, trivia about shows I used to watch when I was younger, and so on. 



And it got me thinking, short of removing all the tech from my life (which is something I cannot do), is there any way to be motivated to work, when your work is built around something that is constantly reminding you that there's more interesting things than your work? If any of you also have jobs that require you to be online for a large amount of time, please do tell how you manage to not get distracted or procrastinate. :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1l8qp3z/does_productivity_inherently_need_a_sterilized/,11-06-2025

Productivity,RaIsThatYouMaGuy22,Struggling to build new habits? Try this.,"So you're struggling with adding new habits to your routine. 

This is something I’ve been implementing for a while now. 
 
Habit stacking is basically that. A way to attach a new habit to an existing one by using the formula:

“After I [existing habit], I will [new habit].”

Your brain already has established neural pathways for your existing habits, as they're essentially second nature, so you leverage that automation to build new behaviours. 

Instead of trying to remember to do something new, you link it to something you already do. 

I’ve used this method to integrate all my passions into my daily routine without feeling overwhelmed. 

It took work at the start, but by identifying links, I'm now able to tackle my passions daily with ease. 

Below are the examples of new habits I used to implement with old habits:

- While I make my morning coffee (existing habit), I listen to an Arabic podcast for 10 minutes (new habit). 
- After I complete my gym workout (existing habit), I write some threads or newsletter topics on the treadmill (new habit). 
- After I eat dinner (existing habit), I review my French flashcards (new habit). 
- After I brush my teeth at night (existing habit), I write three things I’ve achieved in my day and three things I'm looking to tackle tomorrow (new habit). 

This system works because I’m not trying to find time for four separate interests; I’m weaving them into routines I already follow.

The key is starting small and being consistent rather than trying to stack massive new habits onto existing ones.

So, whether you work remotely or on site, I would love to hear how you start your day.

I’ll go first.

I actually have two different routines depending on the day:

MWFSun – These are my workout days. I usually start with a quick 5km run in the morning. It really helps me get that mental clarity and productivity boost. You know that feeling when you’re not just sitting at your desk all day, your body feels lighter? That’s why I made running a part of my routine (plus, I kind of have to.. I signed up for a few fun runs already 😅).

TThSat – These are my “rest” days from running. We don’t have house help during these days, so I spend my morning helping my mom with chores around the house.

But regardless of the day, I never start work without first tidying up my desk and writing my to-do list. Before I jibble in, I give myself 30 minutes to declutter and wipe things down. No clutter = clear mind.

I usually start working around 10 AM, and the latest would be 1 PM.

I've found myself in a role that requires tracking anywhere between 30-100 contracts at a time and I'm trying to figure out the best way to track that without getting bogged down by tasking.

I play several parts in the contract completions; data pulling, pricing, submissions, etc... but there is always a step after each of mine that requires someone else's action. I don't want to add each of these actions outside of my control to the wall of actions I have, but I do want a reminder to followup if I haven't seen a response after a few days. 

I'm finding myself either drowning in actions, where I don't feel like I can focus on ANY of it, because it's too much, or I'm not tracking enough of these actions, and something that wasn't important 2 weeks ago is now a bigger problem because I never received the response I requested.

I am hoping for some sort of template where I can just sort of say ""I'm working FT07 and FT08"" and it will sort of provide all of the steps needed for both of those projects, but also won't drown me with 70 current actions for each of my ongoing projects.

There is plenty of research on how many productive hours people spend in an office workday - typically, depending on exact how productivity is defined/measured and the individual study, the general figure is 2.5-5 hours of productivity in an 8-hour workday. 

I’m looking for more general data that encapsulates productivity beyond just a person’s day job. I.e. How many hours per day does a person spend “being productive” (professional work, learning a new skill, resistance tasks, etc.). Obviously this is a bit difficult to define and depends on the researcher - things like the drive to work, socializing, or cooking may or may not be considered productive. 

Has anyone found more general research on this beyond the office setting? I feel like I’m in a capitalist research hellscape because I can’t find anything else. 😂

Productivity,foundtheglitch,do you keep doing nothing & call it laziness?,"have you ever sat down to work, to write, to clean or to build? but nothing happns. you stare, you scroll, you snack, you disappear?

then that voice we know all too well comes in: 

1. 'you're lazy'
2. 'you just need more discipline'
3. 'what is wrong with you''

you dismiss it, then carry on staring, scrolling, snacking...

  
i listened to that voice for years, telling myself i was weak or i was broken, defective even; the more i tried to force myself to focus, the more i froze. then i got guilty about it. what no one told me is that my nervous system was stuck in survival mode. i had to, by trial and error, figure out what was happening to me. i wasn't lazy, i was protecting myself.

  
the vagus nerve is the main line between your brain, heart, lungs & gut, it decides whether your'e in fight, flight or freeze. it also decides whether your calm, grounded and present.

  
when its regulated, you feel clear, you can focux, breathe deeply, feel things without that overwhelming feeling. but when its dysregulated, you start misfiring, you get foggy, anxious, numb, irritable and distracted.

  
you aren't avoiding tasks because you're weak, you're avoiding them because your body feels unsafe doing them, that's why it is so hard to do these things. you are literally going against thousands of years of brain training.

  
i called this thing my shadow (may have taken inspiration from dexters 'dark passenger') but the shadow will whisper things to me like:

1. 'youll do it later'
2. 'just one more video'
3. 'you're tired, you're behind, you're broken'

and i'd listen to my shadow, it wasn't because i was lazy, it was because the shadow hijacked me, my nervous system was hijacked, it now perceived basic tasks as threats.

  
i tried every system, every planner, every habit app, every routine, and still found myself doing absolutely nothing. after years of trying to figure it out:

>the answer isnt to push harder, its to regulate first

here's what worked for me, there are different ways to regulate your nervous systems (vagus nerve specifically) but these were my favourite picks:

1. **humming**: two minutes. doesn’t matter what it sounds like. your vagus nerve connects to your vocal cords, humming signals safety. i do it before i sit down to work. it changes everything.
2. **cold water**: face dunks, cold showers, or even a splash on the neck. cold activates the parasympathetic system, teaches your body to calm down under pressure.
3. **long exhales**: inhale for 4 seconds, exhale for 8. do it while walking, lying down, or in bed. your nervous system listens to your breath.

And I also appreciate that it isn't trying to do too much at once like I've seen with other PM systems. I also really like the email function where you can email a task and it adds it and their AI automatically sets the date by your note. I love this.

One drawback is that it has no autosave function to its tasks. I tend to leave a task open while doing research (I.e. like today, I was adding contacts to a task I wanted to go back to next week, so I left the task open as I added people, for example). And my browser crashed and that task had been left open, unsaved (cause I wanted to go back to it and add to it easily, not smart obviously). 

What would you recommend? I kind of want a hub for notes to connect to any ongoing projects or clients I'm working with, along with one to add in daily one off or ongoing tasks, and I really love the email a task function. I have a really old PC, so it needs to be web based.

Not a workout, not a long hike - just 10-15 minutes outside.

Andrew Huberman suggests something very similar as well.

The difference is night and day. Something about that immediate forward motion sets my entire nervous system in ""go mode"" instead of ""scroll mode."" I used to wake up, check my phone, and somehow lose an hour before even starting my day.

Now I'm dressed, outside, and moving before my brain has time to negotiate with itself. By the time I'm back, I'm already in motion - both literally and mentally. The rest of my day just flows better.

The key is the 5-minute window. Any longer and I start making excuses or getting distracted. Any shorter and I'm still in that groggy decision-making phase.

Forward ambulation = forward momentum. Simple as that.

I've never stuck with a fully thought out daily schedule, more just to do lists and reminders. In my reading here time blocking a daily schedule, and using habit stacking to make my big list of things more manageable seem like good ideas. Any advice for first time doing those things? And I'm also open to other ideas.

Here's my full list of things, from my daily template I use in a note app. How would you break this stuff down and schedule it, just for example? I could tailor it to my needs from there. And I am someone who can use the extra reminders and structure, so the thing of ""start with just 3 things"" hasn't worked for me etc, since I really will forget about flossing if I don't write that down, for example. Maybe one day more things will become ingrained easy habits though.

Also a few of my goals are to do less of something, under 4 hours of phone time and under 1.5 hours of internet browsing for example. So I do check in on those, but not sure if I just put reminders on the daily schedule somehow as well, or other strategies for those. 

Thanks, here's the big list at the moment, including a couple fun entertainment goals for the summer.

Productivity,digital-spy,Controversial take: “It’s not about the time tracker. It’s how it’s used.”,"I posted about time tracking for remote workers a while back. I have always heard about it as a red flag, something that felt more like a micromanagement tool than anything helpful for productivity or invoicing.

But after reading through so many comments, I wanted to share some insights I have picked from freelancers across the board:

**1. It is not the tracker that’s the issue, but how clients use it.**

Someone who works at Jibble, a developer behind Buddy Punch, and another employee from WebWork agreed that it is not the tracker that’s the issue, but how the company uses it.

When there is mutual trust and the tracker is used for visibility (attendance/invoicing), not control, it can help both sides. Freelancers get paid fairly. The client gets peace of mind.

But given that they are affiliated to these tools, don’t you think it’s a bit biased? Hence, the title.

**2. Some freelancers use trackers for themselves.**

A few mentioned using time trackers (Toggl Track, Jibble, Clockify), not because they have to, but because it helps them improve their quotes, pace their work, or just stay accountable.

Are you one of those people?

**3. Screenshot monitoring is a dealbreaker for most.**

I completely agree with this. Any type of monitoring: mouse tracking, screen recording, or frequent screenshots is a deal breaker. Many said they are okay with logging time, but this surveillance tracking is a dealbreaker. 

(I wonder what other annoying features make a time tracker a dealbreaker or make it feel toxic, or are we back to the main point, that it all depends on how it is enforced?)

**4. Output-based work doesn’t need timers.**

Designers, marketers, editors, etc., noted that their work is often deliverable-based, so tracking hours doesn't always reflect real value. But others still use timers (as their preference) to price their projects more accurately.

But do you know what I am mostly surprised about? That there are some folks who use time trackers to develop their habits..

But do you know what’s the most surprising takeaway for me? Some remote workers/freelancers use time trackers to build better habits.

Yup, a few actually said it helped curb procrastination and gave them structure throughout the day.. Aren’t they micromanaging themselves with this? Haha, kidding aside.

Productivity,DiscoCrows,How do you track Non-Actionable thought and reminders?,"Hi all!

I know that this sub is ripe with advice and input on actionable, task-management software and management tips - but I am coming wondering about something a bit off the beaten path.

I often find myself having internal dialogue in my head, and often am able to draw conclusions or thoughts that serve as productive reminders or motivators that I wish I was able to keep track of in a more streamlined manner akin to my actual tasks that I am remembering I have to do/moving then to my task management software.

Things like ...

* *""During coffee with Alex, he said to stop stressing so much in the moment about things - this is a reminder to park those things and keep moving on with your day. I really want to be more proactive about this!""*
* *""I'm realizing I am spending too much time dwelling on specific people that aren't reciprocating my relationships as much as I'd like. Friendly reminder to myself to shoot enough shots that you can move on from the ones that aren't landing. Socially, and professionally.""*

(The content isn't the point - these are just things I've written down that I have found to be a helpful boost/motivator whenever my eyes glance at them in my journal, which is few and far between).

I'm interested in finding a way to structure/integrate my ""fleeting thoughts for future, passing reference"" into my day-to-day life a bit more, and I am wondering how to do that. As much as I'd love to continue dumping them either into my email inbox, a Google Keep note, or a handwritten journal, the only times I am seeing them/re-reading them/interpreting them and find them helpful is when I go *back* to add more random words/verbaige/reminders to a journal in a totally unstructured manner.

It's different then adding a task to my calendar, because well, it's not actionable or time-sensitive - but it is important to set something up that allows me to reference my own ""soft-goals/talking points"" as I move through my to-do-list.

Has anyone explored this sort of thing and how would you recommend approaching? Over the past months, I've just been emailing myself random passing thoughts and ""starring"" them so they always appear in a big list at the top of my inbox, but more so I don't lose them and less because I am actually looking at them.

I had an idea to copy/paste some of them into a Canva template and save the text as images into a rotating Widgit carousel on my desktop and phone home screens so I see/read them in passing on a more regular basis. A bit of work, but something that keeps it in front of me and fresh in my mind is what I am looking for. Wondering if there's a more natural/obvious way to approach it all, that I'm not thinking of.

Productivity,Don-Xender,Why are very intelligent people often paralyzed by action ?,"You probably know someone who has a thousand ideas, analyzes everything, but never moves forward.

It’s not laziness...

It’s often an excess of unmanaged intelligence.

In fact, in The War of Art, Steven Pressfield says :

“The greatest enemy of creativity is Resistance. And Resistance loves brilliant people.”

Because a brilliant mind will always find a logical excuse not to act.
It sees too many risks, too many alternatives, too many unknowns.

It’s like a pilot who spends his life studying the plane… but never takes off.

Meanwhile, “average” people dive in, make mistakes, try again… and eventually succeed.

Moral of the story: It’s better to move forward clumsily than to think brilliantly while standing still.

Productivity,sophsinc,I summarized top Reddit Self-Help Posts... this is the cheatsheet,"I went through a ton of top self-help, productivity, and ""get your life together"" type subreddits, looking at their all-time best posts and what's been popping off these past years and mashed it all into the cheatsheet below. 

*(Disclaimer: This is a mashup of what Reddit collectively thinks is good advice + my own two cents. Not a doctor, financial advisor, or guru. Do your own homework and talk to actual experts, especially about health or money stuff.)*


________________________________________
**I. MINDSET & SUCCESS**
1. Optimism + hard work: Believing that most challenges can be overcome with enough hard work can greatly improve performance. Obstacles are simply challenges waiting to be overcome.

2. Habits: Small, consistent, daily positive actions can build an amazing life over time. The same applies to small, repeated neglects, which lead to failure. Focus on building strong, positive rituals.

3. Action: Stop over-planning and start doing. Learn from every attempt, especially failures, adjust your approach and try again. Real-world experience is always useful.

4. Authenticity: Be genuine. People are drawn to, respect and trust those who are true to themselves.

5. The power of showing up: A significant part of achieving anything is simply being there and doing the work consistently. Persistence eventually pays off.

6. The Daily Thankfulness Ritual: Acknowledge two or three things you're grateful for each day. This will shift your focus to the positive and boost your mood with minimal effort.

7. Trust your gut: Often, your common sense will tell you the right path to take. When the time comes to take action, trust your intuition.

8. Regular, honest self-reflection: Be objective when looking at your actions, progress and areas that need improvement. 

9. Use your strengths and manage your weaknesses: Focus your energy on your strengths. Make your weaknesses just 'good enough' so that they don't lead to critical failures.

10. Adaptability: Life is dynamic. Be flexible. Making small, frequent adjustments is crucial for successfully navigating challenges.

11. Discipline is consistent execution. Create a plan and stick to it, both when you're struggling and when you're succeeding. Don't let your emotions get in the way of your process.

12. Strategic Silence: Discussing your goals too early can give you a false sense of accomplishment and reduce your motivation to take action. Let your results speak for themselves.



________________________________________
**II. Health insights**
1. Prioritise sleep (6–8 hours): Getting less than this on a consistent basis can have a huge negative impact on your well-being.

2. Maintain a consistent sleep schedule: Go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day. This regulates your body's internal clock.

3. Optimise your sleep environment:
Temperature: The optimum temperature is 16-18°C (61-64°F).
- 1 hour before bed: avoid screens and intense exercise, and minimise stress to prepare your body for rest.

4. Meditation: It improves focus and reduces stress.

5. Get outside and enjoy nature. It has long been associated with better health and fewer illnesses.

6. Limit or avoid alcohol: It is linked to many diseases, including Alzheimer's, dementia and cancers. It improves long-term health.

7. The danger of inactivity: Not exercising is often said to be worse for your health than smoking, diabetes and heart disease combined.

8. Evening smartphone use: Reducing evening smartphone use increases happiness, focus, and well-being.

9. Dark chocolate (in moderation): Considered a superfood, it is good for physical health and cognitive function.

10. Additional health tips often include:
Hydration is key: Drink water throughout the day. This optimises brain and body function.

*Minimise processed foods and added sugar. This reduces inflammation and energy crashes.*

- Morning sunlight: 10–20 minutes of exposure. This regulates your circadian rhythm.
- Strategic Breathwork (Wim Hof, Box Breathing). This impacts energy and stress levels.
- Nasal breathing: prioritise it, especially during sleep. It improves oxygenation.


________________________________________
**III. Productivity & Habits**
1. Small goals for big progress: Break large tasks down into small, manageable daily or weekly steps. This builds momentum.

2. Deep Work Blocks: Dedicate focused, uninterrupted time (60–90 minutes, or 'ultradian rhythms') to important tasks. Multitasking reduces efficiency.

3. Design your environment for success:
Use the ""20-Second Rule"": Make good habits easy (e.g. put your gym clothes out). Make bad habits harder (hide the junk food).
Minimise distractions: Keep your workspace clean. Use noise-cancelling headphones if needed.

4. Set digital boundaries.
- Grayscale your phone: This reduces the allure of addictive apps.
- Curate your information diet: Unfollow ruthlessly.
Strategic notification management: Turn most off. Batch-check.
Utilise app blockers. For specific work periods.

5. The 'Mind Dump': Before bed, write down all your thoughts and to-dos. This improves sleep.

6. The art of saying 'no': Your time and energy are valuable. Saying 'no' is a critical skill.

7. Automate repetitive, low-value tasks. Free up your mental space.

8. Prepare for tomorrow: Review and plan to set yourself up for a productive morning.

**IV. Social and financial well-being:**
*Become an exceptional listener: Ask open-ended questions. Focus on understanding. This builds strong connections.*

1. Be proactive in your relationships. Don't wait. Reach out. Meaningful social connection is important.

2. Practise financial discipline:
- *Save consistently (aim for 10–20%+). Pay yourself first.*
*Invest wisely (in yourself and diversified assets). Make your money work for you.*
- *Track your spending carefully. Know where your money goes. Budget.*
- *Protect your assets. Ensure you have adequate insurance.*

________________________________________
**V. CONTINUOUS GROWTH:**
1. Lifelong learning: Seek new knowledge and skills. Read, listen and take courses.
2. Seek mentors: Learn from people who have achieved what you aspire to.
3. Embrace constructive discomfort. Step out of your comfort zone. Learn to handle setbacks.
4. Develop emotional skills: Understand your triggers. Learn healthy coping mechanisms.
5. Focus on the process, not just the outcome. Find satisfaction in growth.

You can read every self-help book and every Reddit post, but until you start applying these principles, even in small ways, nothing fundamentally shifts.

Productivity,DG_2500,Looking for people serious about self-improvement who need the right circle around them,"Hey everyone, 

I’m sure we’ve all heard these sayings:

“You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.”

“Tell me who your friends are and I will tell you who you are.”

“Birds of a feather flock together.”

Finding like minded people in person may be challenging due to your situation. 

That’s the boat I am currently in…

I just came up with an idea to help people (myself included) who want to be surrounded by other people with similar mindsets of self improvement. 
Which is why I want to create a group of people who are committed to wanting to change where they are in their lives currently. Encourage one another, celebrate small and big wins, share things they’ve learned and everything in between. 

It’s not a ploy to share a course or anything like that. There’s no one leader, we’re all equals just trying to better our lives and need community. 

I have some ideas of how it would work, but I am open to all and any suggestions on what the logistics of the community would be like: what app would we be on (discord, teams, etc); scheduled meetings if any; how big the group should be; should we divide the overall community into sections of different self development goals (i.e. health, finances, relationships, sobriety, etc). 

My vision is that no matter where any of us in the world are we can all have this community to encourage each other and learn from each other. 

If you’re seriously interested, or even just wanting to test the waters, please private message me and I’ll subsequently create a group where we could all meet virtually. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1l5ykd4/looking_for_people_serious_about_selfimprovement/,07-06-2025

I feel like I cannot enjoy life like this nor do I feel like I appreciate life nearly enough always being behind a screen and needing constant dopamine there are many books I’d love to read many thing I’d love to write many things I’d like to also study in general but it’s always my phone and short attention span thats stopping me.

Productivity,TopScoreACT,How I stopped procrastinating and took steps toward my life,"My default, like many people, is to take the path of least resistance, ignore difficult or unpleasant tasks and push things back far back if I can.

However, the last couple of years I was faced with many priorities in life, and I had to find a way to just get things done and move forward with things. For example, I was starting a new job, moving, had car issues, family matters, you name it. Through this process, I developed ways to stop procrastinating and to face things head on.

I learned to stop overthinking and take action toward the task. I realized when I was using perfectionism as an excuse to not take the first step. I came across people I found inspiring such as David Goggins and Cameron Hanes. I read books such as Atomic Habits by James Clear. I broke complicated or hard tasks into simple steps and gained confidence when I completed them.

These simple changes allowed me to take steps toward my goals and better face the tasks that I found difficult, complicated or scary to do. It also helped me better understand why I procrastinated or avoided tasks.

I break down some of these insights and strategies I gained in a short free guide that can help you stop procrastinating and take steps toward your life and goals.

Here’s what I need — and what most tools don’t handle well:

* I have different types of tasks: some take 5 minutes, others take days. I want to treat them differently.
* Some tasks don’t need to be done today or even this week, but I want to keep them in sight — just not in my face every day.
* I need to track priorities, rough complexity, time estimates, deadlines — not just a title and checkbox.
* I want to see what I *could* do today, but not get overwhelmed by a huge flat list.
* I want to plan my week, or my month, and see progress. But most tools are either too rigid (like calendars) or too loose (like notes or endless to-do lists).

Basically, I wish I had a flexible personal system — like a backlog with sortable columns: urgency, priority, size, deadline, etc.

Productivity,WestRoman23,Update - [Day 5] No-Caffeine Journey - My Reflection on quitting coffee and being more productive,"I've been posting my journey on reddit for quitting coffee and checking in on **Day 5** of my journey to break free from caffeine addiction. I made a post on Day 1 and the support + shared experiences were incredibly helpful — thank you to everyone who chimed in.

# How It’s Going:

Short answer: It’s rough. But not impossible.

Long answer:

* **Headaches**: Hit me on Day 2, got worse on Day 3. but I've been using ice packs when it peaks. Definitely helps.
* **Fatigue**: It’s like my body forgot how to make energy on its own. I feel like I'm wading through molasses, and I’m not sure if I’m tired, sad, or just bored without a buzz.
* **Mood swings**: Real. One moment I’m zen, the next I’m irrationally annoyed because my tea isn't “coffee” enough.
* **Sleep**: Starting to feel a bit better. Still waking up groggy, but at least I *can* fall asleep at a normal hour. Hoping this continues to improve.

# What’s Helping:

* **Hydration**: Drinking water like it’s my part-time job. Herbal teas, electrolytes, lemon water — whatever it takes.
* **Calendar streak**: Logging my days has been more motivating than expected. I’m using my iPhone calendar + NOCAF app (their money/calories saved from not drinking caffeine is fantastic).
* **Mental reminders**: Every time I crave a coffee, I remind myself why I quit: anxiety, poor sleep, and the $$ drain.

# Adjustments to My Plan:

I originally planned to take it easy with workouts, but I might actually *lightly* reintroduce movement. Even a 15-min walk or gentle yoga helps lift the fog. Some folks recommended HIIT or sauna to boost brain chemistry (BDNF), but I’m not there yet.

# Reflections:

* I underestimated how much of my identity was tied to “coffee person” vibes — the rituals, the energy, the culture. Breaking up with that has been... emotional?
* The craving isn't *just* for caffeine. It's also for control, routine, productivity — and it’s uncomfortable to sit in stillness when you’ve been caffeinated out of it for years.
* I’m learning that discomfort ≠ danger. It's just... withdrawal.

# What I’m Looking Forward To:

* The day I wake up feeling *naturally* rested.
* Not being chained to a daily caffeine dose just to function.
* More stable moods + energy.
* Proving to myself that I can finish hard things I start.

If you’re a few steps ahead of me, I’d love to hear how you felt around Days 6-10. Any surprises? Wins? Setbacks?

If you’re just starting — or thinking about starting — come join in. Even just reducing caffeine is a win. And trust me, if I can make it 5 days, **you can too**.

Stay hydrated, stay strong, and embrace the fog 🌫️

**TL;DR**: Day 5 of quitting caffeine. Tired, headache, emotional — but motivated. No regrets. Better sleep and small mental shifts are keeping me going. Let's keep moving.",https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1l5wmgw/update_day_5_nocaffeine_journey_my_reflection_on/,07-06-2025

The thing is, most sources say to focus on 5 or fewer tasks in a day that are really important. But I have more than that which would really help me as daily habits, and I've been trying at it for many years.

I have a daily template in Keep notes with around 15 items, which includes say when to head up to bed, when to wind-down off screens, habits like meditation, reading books, exercises, etc. And a few of them are tracking goals like keeping internet browsing under 2 hrs in a day, phone screen use under 4 hours, etc.

It can be a lot to try to keep track of, and I've used a few apps too. And several ways of reminding myself. And have not succeeded so far at making these things all regular routines.

So, if you find you need that extra reminder and need to keep track of a larger number of things every day, and to actually do them too, how do you do it? Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1l5hnm5/how_to_keep_track_of_10_daily_habit_routines/,07-06-2025
Productivity,Tactical_Thinking,Fixing one thing/process/problem at a time?,"Hey everyone, 

I'm working on a service proposition idea based on a common problem I have seen a few times with my clients. I would like to hear what you think of this approach.

I'm a project and product manager with a background in large companies and currently working with a few startups and solo founders. Over the last 2 years I have seen a couple of these people flop projects because they got stuck in operational mess. Firefighting everywhere instead of getting things done.

Largers companies just throw more hands at the problem and get used to living with it, but for startups and solo founders, this can be fatal. They don't have the resources, and a full audit or even hiring a PM would blow up their budgets. In 12 months I've seen 4 projects that I personally liked get killed because these people were so overwhelmed in operations that couldn't crawl out of the hole they dug themselves. 

So here's the idea: 

Instead of trying to make everything perfect, a targeted tactical engagement to fix one mess at a time. Lean, short and fast at an accessible price for solo builders and SMBs. 

No long term commitment, no retainer or monthly payments. I come in, collect the information about what's not working, diagnose, propose and apply a fix, deliver the documentation and get out of the way in a short timeframe. 

Stuff like:

-Task intake is not organized. Let's fix it. 

-Deliveries are getting delayed. Let's find the bottleneck and clear it. 

-Decisions are not clear, don't get made or take too long. Let's review the gating process and lay out clear rules.

-Client onboarding is bad/not working/ taking too long. Let's rebuild it. 

-a bunch of tools doing overlapping things and not talking to each other. Let's streamline this and get rid of the overhead. 



Question to you: would you, in the receiving end, feel that this has real value to you/your operation, and would help you deliver better and faster?

Productivity,gits97,Multitasking is the least productive habit ever,"Soo... Few years back, when I was finishing university I went big into being ""very productive"". I would do some extreme stuff like write homework in metro (sometimes standing), sleep ridiculously few hours but made sure it was a multiple of 1.5h to match the sleep cycle and feel good anyway when I woke up. And multitasking was one of the toxic habits that I got into: I would write emails during lectures, see some of the videos about a subject while eating, then (when I started working) scheduling meetings that was almost intentionally back to back despite knowing one would last longer... stuff like that.

Few years after all of this, a lot of mental problems started to come to the surface (not necessarily related to or coming from these habits) which got me into therapy and meditation. And here's the catch - during these meditations, I realized, that multitasking is just another name of being non-mindful. It's like: you're not writing an email AND listening to the lecture at the same time, you're just doing none of those things really.

In long term, purely from productivity perspective it's way better to have some time to do one thing fully committed and focused, then gracefully do a context switch and do something different. You just make both of those things better, higher quality and generally strain your psyche way less and enjoy doing stuff much more.

**You know like when you always wait for some thing to finish at work/life/wherever to start something else and then if you actually look at it, none of it ever finishes and you are stuck in this loop of always rushing and being out of time and not meeting a deadline. As counter intuitive as it may sound, just ignoring some of the stuff that you feel like are super important and doing one thing like there's nothing else in this word: slowly, in your time, with full focus will help you get x100 more done. And you'll look back and realize that you met all the deadlines, had all the time for vacation, stressed much less and are still happy.**

Today I try to only do one thing at a time. Even when I'm eating, I try to put down my phone, and try to not even think about anything else, rather focus on eating, savoring each and every bite, enjoying it, making a pause and being grateful for THIS sensation, and let me tell you something: boy does it work...

With the power of synchronicity (or pure chance) I came across a book called ""Deep Work"" by Cal Newport and it talks about this very topic, which I highly suggest.

**TL;DR**  
**You have no idea how big of a world is happening in front of your eyes without you noticing it. Just try to sit down and eat one meal, fully focused on eating sensation and nothing more: no phone, no videos, no thinking, I guarantee you, you'll start to feel how different that sourdough and poached egg taste like from what you thought they tasted like.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1l53gs6/multitasking_is_the_least_productive_habit_ever/,06-06-2025
Productivity,iwantboringtimes,The Fundamental Good Habits have Huge Effects.,"In military circles, there's the saying:

> Amateurs talk about tactics, but professionals study logistics.

And that's cause even the best tactics are shit without enough resources at the right place and at the right time.

If our sleep is lousy, if the food we're eating ain't healthy (and we don't get enough exercise to unclog our internal supply chains); IF we cannot properly track our money (and pile on unnecessary debts) - the internal stresses inside our brain and body just won't let us make proper use of even the best tactics or the best apps.

So, please get the fundamental FOUNDATIONAL good habits on your corner.  When we've got good sleep, good food (and maybe runner's high), a good budget watching our financial backs - even a simple to do list on pen and paper can turn you into a productivity powerhouse.

They think they’re making progress, but in reality, they’re just going in circles with their notes.

Read less… but better.

Read, reflect, apply.

That’s how you go from simply consuming ideas to actually building something.

Do you apply for a passport now because you have the means, even if you don’t need it yet — or wait until you have travel plans?



Do you complete a 20-hour training now just because you have free time, even though the certification isn’t needed yet — or wait until you get a job that requires it?



Do you buy a beautiful set of plates now even though you live alone and won’t use them regularly — or wait until you have a family that would use them?

I recently joined an organization where our entire project management ""system"" consists of... Excel to-do lists.

Here's the big picture: I'm supervising 3 people in a 15-person division (part of a larger 100+ employee department), and honestly, tracking everything through spreadsheets is not ideal. I'd love to introduce something more modern – ideally with weekly sprints similar to Agile Scrum methodology.

I don't want to go hat-in-hand asking for budget approval right away. I'd rather prove that a proper PM tool actually works before I ask leadership to open their wallets. Perhaps, show results first, then ask for money.

I'm looking for something that can handle:

* Project status tracking
* Team comments and collaboration
* Basic automations
* Reporting capabilities
* Dashboards I can share with senior management

Ideally, I need something with a low barrier to entry (free or very cheap to start) but that won't box us in if we want to scale up later. Has anyone successfully made this transition in a similar environment? What tools worked well for getting buy-in from both your team and upper management?

Hi sooo I’m a super shy person... like extra shy. The type of shy that feels sorry just for existing :< I overthink every little thing and I have BPD (I do see a therapist btw).

Because of all that, I literally have no friends or anyone to talk to. I get too in my head, too scared to text first, and when I’m around people I act all robotic just so I don’t embarrass myself. I never act like me.

But I’m sooo done with that. I’m tired of feeling stuck. I want to stop caring what anyone thinks. Even if they say something, so what? I want to be free.

I always feel jealous of people who just live their truth, be themselves, and don’t care what others say or think. Like (entp/enfp/..) But today, I don’t want to just watch and wish. I want to *be* that.

I want to live loud, real, and free. I want to feel like me for once.

And honestly… I need help and guides walk me through what to actually do. 

I don’t mean advice like “just be confident” or “don’t overthink” I mean something real. Something that actually moves something inside, something that helps me break out of this cage.

I’ve told myself this a hundred times before. Made the same promises. But I never follow through. I don’t want to keep living like this.

Over that past several years, I’ve tried a number of task management apps and techniques: Sunsama, Motion, Notion, Asana, etc. 

They’re all great products, but are hindered by the same thing: they’re not always in front of me. They tend to get hidden away because they aren’t on the same screen as slack and my browser. 

I needed something physical that would always be in my eye line. 

Enter: index cards

I had a pack laying around and figured if it doesn’t fit on an index card, it’s too much of a task anyway. 

I’m also a fan of kanban, so I purchased some index card holders to act as a kanban board. 

Here’s my method:
Any time I get a task, write it down and put it in the backlog. Once or twice a week, prioritize the backlog by reordering the cards. Each day, move a few cards into the today bucket and finish those tasks. If I finish those tasks, I put the in done and I can pull another from the prioritized backlog. 

There’s also a blocked bucket if something needs to be revisited on occasion.

Most of us are pretty much running on coffee these days, either because it actually helps or because we’re too far gone to quit. But if you haven’t tried L-theanine with your coffee yet, you’re sleeping on one of the best hacks out there.

L-theanine is this amino acid that naturally shows up in tea leaves. It basically smooths out caffeine’s rough edges. That’s why drinking tea hits different.. you get the energy, but without feeling like your brain is trying to moonwalk out of your skull.

No wonder the world went to war over tea. Imagine being some British dude back in the day like, *“Bruv, I just filed all my paperwork in an hour, and I’m calm as hell.”*

L-theanine chills you out harder than a fart in a yoga class. Like, you’re locked in but mellow. Focused but not frantic. It's the vibe we all pretend we have on LinkedIn.

I usually pop some (about 300mg) about 30 to 60 minutes before my coffee. Zero jitters. Mental clarity for hours. Absolute game changer.

L-Theanine Supplements aren’t even that expensive either.

What unique dashboard/templates have been immensely useful for you?

(This can be a template you bought or built yourself.)

Over the past three years of using Notion, these have been the areas where they’re most useful:

- Meal planning & grocery management
- Resume building / Career Tracking
- Automated check-ins (looped a dashboard with Zapier to send me emails linked to automation)
- Cost splitting for group activities/events/travel (There’s a lot of manual tweaking here but it actually is more efficient vs. Sheets if you know your way around formulas)
- Health management (I have a dashboard that tracks symptoms, medicine intake, doctors appointments)
- Travel planning (so far, the best platform I’ve used to plan my travels — nothing compares)

Notion,Sad_Play1582,Defining a variable and using variable to modify relation,"Hello all.

I am trying to build an automation that, when triggered, defines a variable, then uses that variable to change a relation property.

The goal is to filter the pages in a relation property, and update a different relation property with the pages that were filtered. Both relation properties are linked to the same DB. Essentially the first relation property contains all pages in the DB, and the second would contain the filtered pages from the first relation.

Right now the automation is set up like this:

Trigger: when prop is edited

Action:

Define variables(page filter): trigger page. All pages relation. Filter (filter criteria)

Edit trigger page filtered relation property: set pages to custom formula = page filter variable.

When I use the formula to define the variable in an actual db formula property, it works perfectly, but when I use it in the automation it doesn’t work at all. Please help!

[Image of the tool being used](https://preview.redd.it/7kt24yomgh6f1.png?width=1111&format=png&auto=webp&s=27905378d1b4298e9b7a40f79bfcc0831b804c7f)

I have created this simple setup where you do **either one of the following** and it generates PDFs with neat formatting:

1. **Provide -> Notion Page Share URL = Generates Single PDF.**

**Note:** Notion Page must be *Shared* here.

**2. Provide -> Notion Page Share URL + Notion Database URL + Notion API Key = Generates Multiple PDFs.**

**Notes:** *This is handy for Invoices, Contracts etc which requires the same template to follow for each file.*

Notion Database and the Notion Page must be *Shared* here.

**3. Provide -> Notion Database URL + Notion API Key = Generate Multiple PDFs**

**Notes:** Notion Database must be *Shared* here.

This i*s handy for notes, random documents, lectures etc which doesn't follow a template each file.*

Works like a gem 100% of the time to generate the PDFs cleanly.

Anyone would be interested to try this out and give me feedback on improvement?

Notion,JustANamelessFace,Help with Game Mod Tracker,"Hey, I'm hoping someone could give me a hand (hopefully what I want to do is relatively easily achievable). I’m currently using a Notion database to track all the mods I use in The Sims 4 (It started off as the tracker made by Rosannatxt and has evolved a little for my uses), and I’m trying to make it a bit smarter by having it tell me if I’m missing any mod dependents.

Right now I’m using a multi-select column to list the dependents, which works fine as is, but isn’t super helpful when I’m downloading mods post patch and need a quick reference to make sure I have everything important installed (on patch days I create a new version of the page for the new version number). I know I’ll need a formula to do this, and probably a second database but I’m not sure how to go about it.

I’ve got three columns that in my database already that I want to build this from: Mod Name (this is also the page title), a Status column with options like “In Game”, “Broken – Pending Update”, “Broken – Abandoned”, and “Not in Game”, and a Dependents column where I list required mods by name using multi-select.

What I want the formula to do is: check the Dependents list, see if those mods exist in the Mod Name column, then check their Status. If all the dependents are in the list and marked “In Game”, the formula would return something like “All Dependents Present”. If a mod is in the list but has a status like “Not in Game” or “Broken”, then something like “Dependent Missing: Mod Name – Status”. And if it’s not in the database at all, then “Dependent Missing: Mod Name – Mod Missing”.

The idea is to use this in gallery view so I can quickly tell if anything’s missing or broken. So for example, if I had Mod 1 which needed Mod 2, Mod 3, and Mod 4 to work, and Mod 3 wasn’t in game and Mod 4 wasn’t in the database at all, then the gallery card for Mod 1 would show:

>Mod 1

>Version: \[Version Number\]

>Creator: \[Creator Name\]

>\- In Game

>Dependents: Dependent Missing: Mod 3 – Not in Game, Mod 4 – Mod Missing

>Last Downloaded: \[Date\]

I’m still in the process of learning Notion (despite how long I’ve been using it now) and this is just one of those projects where I’ve bitten off more than I can chew and I just don't know where to start to get this to work, so any help/advice I can get on how to make this function how I want it to would be greatly appreciated.

Notion,This_Conclusion9402,Finally figured out a hack for moving Airtable data into Notion and keeping the linked records relationships intact,"So I finally tried moving my main Airtable base to Notion this week. Been on Airtable for years (personal CRM, projects, etc) and was getting annoyed with working out of two tools for some of my tasks.

Tried the CSV import first. Obliterated all my linked records. Just giant flat files. Years of linking projects to tasks to clients... Was looking at just mind-numbing copy/paste to fix it all and about ready to just scrap the whole idea.

Remembered this tool, whalesync. I've only ever used it for keeping stuff in sync two-ways, which, whatever, I don't need that for this I only want to move stuff once. But then I had a thought... wait, if it can sync relations, it can probably just... move them?

So I basically just mapped my Airtable fields to Notion database columns and used whalesync to create all of the tables, fields, and relationships for me. The key thing is it actually gets that a 'Linked Record' in Airtable is a 'Relation' in Notion, which the native importer just completely chokes on.

Turned it on and it took what seemed like a long time to get started but then it just worked. All my data is now in Notion. All of my connections are there. My projects database is still talking to my clients database. Just a solid, mechanical thwack. Everything landed exactly where it was supposed to.

Whalesync isn't free, but for this it is, because it's once and done and they offer a 14 day free trial (with a cc which I don't love but with how much work they did for me for free...)

Probably a solved problem but I thought it was a pretty cool hack and wroth sharing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1l985vv/finally_figured_out_a_hack_for_moving_airtable/,11-06-2025

It was bad enough that things like buttons have different heights depending on if they're properties vs. blocks, but it wasn't so bad with everything else being consistent. Now, however, it seems like they're just designing their stuff in a vacuum without any relation to any other elements.

None of them stuck around for long (except Google Docs, which I still use to backup stuff) . Then I discovered Notion… and fell down the rabbit hole of linked databases, customizable views, and beautifully controlled chaos. And the fully cloud setup. 

Fast forward through many hours (and several near-existential plot crises), and I’ve built a Notion dashboard that now runs my entire novel—from tangled plot threads to cursed geography to suspiciously charming side characters.

It includes:
✍️ Chapters, scenes, timelines, and progress tracking
🧶 Linked plot structure: arcs → main plot → subplots → scenes
🌍 A full worldbuilding hub: characters, cultures, locations, institutions, magic systems
🧠 A note vault for half-baked ideas and “what if the moon is cursed?” research
🎨 Moodboard + ✅task boards + 📈writing stats
📖 A user guide that's somewhat useful (and mildly entertaining)

⚠️ Disclaimer:  This template uses partial fictional examples based on the novel *Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone* by J.K. Rowling, **for educational and illustrative purposes only**

I use it for my own WIP but I’m shy about showing my organised chaos, and revealing spoilers, so I just used a novel that most of us have read and loved. 

I’m now looking for a few fellow writers, worldbuilders, or narrative control freaks to beta test it. Your feedback will help shape the final version before I release it publicly.

🖇️ If you’re interested, drop a comment or DM me and I’ll send the link.

I started asking ChatGPT:

\- “Why does this headline work?”

\- “What persuasion style is being used here?”

\- “How could I rewrite this for a different format?”

The responses were super insightful, so I added them into a structured Notion setup. Now it’s kind of a swipe vault with categories, formats, and AI notes.

Personally, I use Notion's free plan because I can't afford anything else, and as such try not to expect too much ; I use the tools I have and that's fine. But that's fine only when my entire setup isn't destroyed by an update !  
Every single entry in my Notion, and tht's thousands of them, uses the page to list some relevant views of other tables. This is for instance part of my ""daily bujo"" for today. Normally it would show how much I've slept, what I have planned for today, and so on. It's all broken as of today. The data is still there, if I go to each database individually, but it's impossible to visualize it in an entry's page now.  
So what am I supposed to do, go back to the thousands of pages and redo it from scratch to have access to the data I've been tracking for years ?

This is infuriating.

I realize Notion doesn't need my business, as I'm not making them any, but that makes me want to badmouth this company to every person I've previously recommended Notion to, at the very least.

The company may or may not become the new Evernote (aka die slowly) but I'd not bet on them 100% as they keep demonstrating their inability to build a solid reliable tool.

Similarly to Evernote (who still ponders using markdown), Notion never offered an offline mode, easy formulas or ability to import/export data easily. They may or may not....the key value for them is people being locked-in on their platform.

No plan. No progress. Just this heavy, sinking guilt.

I’d hype myself up, write endless lists, set big goals. But by midweek, I was burnt out, frustrated, and starting over again.

After years of that painful cycle — the shame, the doubt — I finally got real with myself. It wasn’t about motivation. I was missing a system.

So I built one.

Three clear goals that keep me focused.

A simple 4-step morning routine that primes my mind and body to win.

Three daily tasks — the essentials that actually move the needle every day.

I added tools like trackers and weekly reviews to keep me honest and on track without the guesswork.

And the part that saved me the most, methods to stay consistent and motivated even on the worst days, when everything inside me wanted to quit.

This system didn’t just change my habits, it changed how I see myself. For the first time in a long time, I felt proud, focused, and powerful.

I put everything I learned into a guide, the exact system and tools I used to break free and build real momentum.

Notion,_WhiteAsDuck_,Help. Numpad does weird things with my display,"I accidentally hit the 3 on the numpad of my laptop. Stupidly enough the display screen started twitching to the left more and more. Sometimes it goes a bit back to the left, but never back to the original position. It doesn't matter what I do: restart the app, try other numpad numbers; sometimes it goes left, sometimes it goes right, sometimes it does nothing. Yes I have numlock 'unlocked', so it now uses the functions of the key and not the number, but that still doesn't make sense to me.

7 (home), 9(pg up) and 3(pg dn) so something, but it doesn't seem consistent.

Anyone who can help? Full width also isn't the problem

Edit: only way i was able to fix it was by re-installing. But I'm still confused.

Notion,IAmKrowdaddy,My only complaint about the UI changes.,"This is one of a handful of database views that I try to keep empty. Why is there four or five rows worth of empty space? Yes, I can just hide it in a dropdown tab, and no, it's not the end of the world. I just want to know why. What was so wrong about the singular new page row that's still there for populated views? Why do empty databases have to take up so much screen reel estate? If they've given a reason why, I'd genuinely like to know. 

Don't get me wrong. I love Notion, and this isn't a ""tHIs aPp is unUsAblE"" post. I've just built every single page I use to be an efficient and **CONDENSED** project/data tracker. This update just made things less condensed, and (to me) it doesn't make much sense.

Notion,BurnerPhoneToronto,Trying to build a smooth Google Calendar → Meeting Notes → Tasks → Notion workflow,"I want to move away from **Asana** and use **Notion as our single source of truth**—for tasks, project management, notes, and collaboration.

I’m trying to find a streamlined way to connect our **Google Calendars**, **meeting notes**, and **tasks** into **Notion**, ideally in a way that keeps everything centralized and collaborative.

We tag our project meetings with a value from our Project List (relative value) - so notes as well as tasks coming into Notion would ideally all be linked to a specific project.

So far, I haven’t found a clean solution that does it all. I’ve looked into:

* **Slack automations**: Limited in terms of deeper task/database integrations.
* **Fellow**: Really great for meetings—it’s linked to our calendars, gives us a great UI for collaborative note-taking, and can push tasks to Asana automatically based on meeting series. Super slick.  However, I can't find a way to get tasks to push or be exported into Notion as tasks within a database.  I understand this logic as to why it's not possible, but I am hoping for a workaround.

While I *can* export meeting notes from Fellow into Notion databases, I **can’t get the tasks (action items) from those meeting notes into our All Tasks database** in Notion in any structured way. That part still feels totally manual.

We’re a small team, committed to Google Workspace (not Microsoft), and we’re on **Notion Enterprise** now. I plan to reach out to Notion support, but I’m not sure whether this is a capability issue or just something that needs a workaround (Make? API? something else?).

Has anyone figured out how to get tasks from Fellow (or any similar tool) into Notion *as structured database items*? Or, is there another tool you’re using that bridges calendar events, collaborative meeting notes, and task creation—all within a Notion-based system?

Notion,Anton_Zhezherun,"Decision Tracker template — a tool for systematic tracking of decisions, context, expectations, and outcomes","**What is this?**  
A structured decision tracker to help you log, review, and improve how you make decisions — personally or professionally.

**Why use it?**

Most people don’t track decisions, so they can’t learn from them. This template shows what you decided, how risky it was, what the outcome was, and whether it was worth repeating.

* Provides *feedback* on thinking → a foundation for better decisions
* Encourages *slowing down thought* before making a choice (formatting as a metacognition tool)
* Reveals recurring mistakes, blind spots, cognitive distortions
* Applicable for personal development, business analysis, self-reflection

**Notes:**

* Works best with **low-frequency**, **high-significance** decisions.
* Can be extended and **adapted to your personal or business needs** — customizable types, categories, and filters.
* The template works best as a decision journal **when used actively with at least ≥20 entries.**

*Versions:*  
**Free** — core tracking and manual insights.  
**Pro** — advanced analytics, charts, performance metrics.

I think there was a global shortcut before they add AI, that would open a small ""new page"" window. 

Do you have any idea or solution?

Notion,kslowpes,Notion AI in Notion Mail is not consistent,"I've been using Notion Mail and Notion AI in it from day one, and while at the start I was pretty impressed by it, that did not persist. 

I have two main labels I wanted to automate, one of them is ""Daily Newsletters"", another one is ""recurring advertisement"". Now, I see this might be a point of contention since both are recurring things, but I think that is the whole point of wanting this automatic sorting. Now, almost every day a few of my daily newsletters will also be marked as recurring advertisement or solely as advertisement. There are days like today that nothing will be labeled at all and when I went to mark a few as Daily Newsletters to ""train"" it, it marked all as Daily Newsletter, Recurring Advertisement and a separate label altogether Finances which I use mostly for receipts.

  
I almost feel at this point that with those it just might be easier to set up a fixed rule as any other email application to deal with, which is not something that you can do through Notion Mail, only being able to that in the actual Gmail settings.

Notion,MW_J97,Making notion faster,"Hello,

I searched a lot for this topic and want to share my experience and also ask for yours if anyone has the same issue.

The most effective methods to solve it:

* Reducing table load limit to 10, maybe it’s small for you and it was like that for me. But, I find it now more powerful, faster and more productive. If I need to view full table, I still have a button to open table as a full page and it’s faster than load it rows by rows.
* Reducing or un-using page covers, I found it more beautiful for me without any covers and also more productive to concentrate more on the content not the shape. If you want use it, try to reduce its size first.
* Also, I tried desktop app even I am using Linux and that’s not very easy to find. But, actually I don’t see difference with the web.

If you don't get one of the 15 team-focused spots, you can still test other parts of the platform, just not team section. many things are beat messy, but I believe that you can handle it.

The landing page also doesn't fully reflect what the platform will become, but I hope to improve that soon too.

Notion,_key,Concerns About the Rise in Self-Promotion Posts and Suggestions to Improve the Sub,"**Dear Notion Subreddit Moderators,**

First, thank you for everything you do. Moderating a community like this takes time and dedication, and I know it's a volunteer effort. Your work is appreciated.

That said, I’d like to bring up some concerns about the current state of the subreddit - specifically around the recent shift in self-promotion rules.

**The Current Situation**

As Notion has grown in popularity, so has the trend of creating and selling templates. I’m not here to judge that - people have different goals, and for many, this is a valid way to earn income. That’s absolutely fine.

The issue is that the sub is increasingly being used as a place to promote templates - some free, many paid. Since the rules were relaxed, it feels like promotional content has started to overwhelm everything else.

In many cases, the posts are low-effort:

* Hashtags clearly copy-pasted from social media
* AI-generated blurbs with placeholders still in place, broken formatting, or missing links and screenshots
* Posts that consist of nothing more than a screenshot and a link
* “Comment or DM for link” posts that may be trying to bypass moderation or even act in bad faith

Other users have mentioned this as well, but it seems like little has changed.

**Suggestions for Improvement**

I don’t want to just criticize - I’d like to offer some constructive ideas for how this could be improved. Some are stricter, others more flexible.

Option 1: Reintroduce the old rule

Disallow all self-promotional posts and instead create a weekly or bi-weekly megathread where users can share templates or tools.

Option 2: Redirect to other subs

Ban (template) self-promotion altogether and direct users to other existing subreddits that are focused on template sharing and digital products.

If these feel too restrictive, here are a few more moderate proposals:

1. Require moderator approval for self-promo

All self-promotional posts must be reviewed and approved by moderators before going live.

2. Enforce a 90/10 rule

Only allow users to post promotional content if they are actively contributing to the community. For instance, at least 90% of their posts and comments should be non-promotional. (And these contributions should not be 9 comments a la ""same"", ""ok"", ""i don't know"" etc. just to post 1 self-promo.)

3. Add a transparency requirement

Users should clearly label when a post or comment promotes their own product or service. For starters, some posts labelled as ""discussion"" are clear self-promo posts, which should be using the ""paid template"" flair. But also comments linking to templates should include info if it's the commenters own product.

4. Raise quality standards

Self-promotional posts should be informative and provide enough context for readers to understand what’s being offered. Buzzwords, vague descriptions, or content that only redirects off-platform without explanation shouldn’t be allowed.

5. Limit posts to Notion-related content

Occasionally, users try to promote unrelated apps or services. These should be removed to keep the sub focused.

6. Apply the rules consistently

The same standards should apply to templates, tools, services, browser extensions, and even promotional videos that exist solely to drive sales. Helpful or educational content is of course welcome, as long as it’s clear, relevant, and useful.

**Rebuilding the Community Feel**

I’m not anti-creator. I’ve found a lot of value in templates and creative tools shared by others. But the community has started to feel more like a marketplace than a place to learn, share, and connect.

Before the rules changed, I was very active - offering advice and participating in discussions. Now I find myself less engaged, discouraged by the flood of repetitive promotions.

On a related note, I remember some promising ideas floated a while back - like AMAs, community flairs, and monthly community contribution. I tried something similar to the community contribution idea recently, and while it didn’t take off, I still believe it could work with the right support. AMAs, in particular, could be a great way to highlight the people behind some of the best tools and workflows or ideas.

If you made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read all of this. I hope it communicates a genuine desire to improve the subreddit. I believe in this community and know it can be even better with a few thoughtful changes.

* Built-in AI prompts (ChatGPT/Claude-ready)
* Reflection pages + habit tracking
* Weekly reviews that actually feel helpful
* A clean, minimal UI that doesn’t stress me out 😅

The idea is simple: show up for 15 minutes a day, use the AI prompt if you're stuck, and reflect honestly. It’s not about doing more—just being more intentional.

- Plan 5-7 tasks each week in a checklist (table view)   
  
- track their progress visually in a Kanban board (To Do → Doing → Done)  

- Without duplicating the tasks manually between the two.  

For example:

""Look up apartments in NYC"" would appear in my checklist for the week (as an example), and I'd move it across the Kanban during the week as I work on it.

Notion,iampp0608,How to use Notion AI to capture To-do items?,"Hi all 

Recently, I subscribed to Notion AI and I want to try using AI to search for all unchecked to-do items within a specific workspace.

I've organized my work data – customer information, parts history, customer complaint lists, quotation lists, contract management, meeting records, etc. – common major categories in manufacturing work, each into a table-formatted database.

So, for example, after a meeting with a client today, I wrote down items requiring follow-up in the pages for different parts. This might include confirming a change to the packaging method for part A, or requesting a new quote for part B, etc. I wrote these items down as to-dos with checkboxes.

However, when I ask Notion AI to find the unchecked to-do items, it cannot accurately list them. Instead, it lists other items that, in the context of the text, might need to be followed up on.

[unchecked to-do item](https://preview.redd.it/ldhn73pzlu5f1.png?width=244&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3a079631bede0185849805eac93a7e9dedf7ed7)

  
Is there room for improvement in my prompt, or are there other ways to accurately find the to-do items?

Notion,Megan167,Create Multiple Database Entries from Form,"I have a health tracker setup in Notion that I built from scratch. Admittedly it's not pretty, but I'm fairly new and trying to make Notion do more than it seems to want to (easily, anyway).

I enter Oura scores twice at this point. Why? Because I want these two different charts to appear. The one is easy - each chart shows each score. The other one is trickier - I want it to show all 3 scores at once. The only way I could figure out to do that was by duplicating the day's entry and changing the score type in each entry. Maybe that's the part that needs to change? Any suggestions there?

If that part can't change, on to my current struggle. I'm creating a form to prompt me to enter these values every day. I assume there must be an automation that I could use to say something like, ""If Score(1) is entered, create a new entry, choose the right score type (Sleep) and put the corresponding value there."" But I can't figure out how to write that argument.

In the end, the important part to me is having these two views of charts and using a form to input the data (because it's otherwise ugly to stare at, so I won't use it).

Entrepreneur,ClawedPlatypus,I closed 200+ freelance deals with this script,"I always thought I sucked at sales.

Got my first job as a telemarketer when I was 16, and I quit 6 hours into my first shift.

It was emotionally exhausting and I honestly felt disgusted.

This experience scarred me for years and held me back when I started building my freelancing business 8 years later.

Then I joined an absurdly expensive mastermind ($7500 / 3 months) where they shared the initial version of the script I'm about to share with you.

And it flipped my entire mindset about what it takes to sell on its head.

Instead of being salesy, they told me to act like a doctor. Diagnose and then confidently present the cure.

After I started doing this, I closed 200+ deals for my freelancing business. From big tech companies all the way down to small mom-and-pop online stores.

Here's the script that changed everything for me:

# The mindset

Before we get into the ""what to say,"" we need to fix the ""how to think."" This is 90% of the battle.

* Your job isn't to push a product; it's to diagnose a problem. You should be listening, asking intelligent questions, and determining **if you're even the right person to help them**. If a doctor listened to your symptoms for 30 seconds and immediately tried to sell you on a specific surgery, you'd run. Don't be that person.
* In the first half of the call, the client should be doing 80% of the talking. If you're talking more than them, you're pitching, not discovering. You're losing.
* You don't need this client. You are evaluating them just as much as they are evaluating you. Think of it like a first date. You're not trying to force a second date from the moment you sit down. You're genuinely trying to see if there's a connection and if you're compatible for a long-term relationship.
* Do not read this word-for-word. Reading makes you sound like a robot and breaks all trust.

# Preparation

Good prep is going to be the source of your confidence. Knowing your questions and your offer ahead of time frees up your mental energy to actively listen.

1. Go through the steps below and write down 3-5 specific questions for each section.
2. **EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Prepare 1-3 clear service packages with prices**. Even if you won’t be able to pitch a productized service, this will help you quickly and without hesitation answer ANY questions regarding your pricing (e.g. ""I've done similar projects for around $4.000). This makes you look like someone who’s been doing this for years, is a professional and even **allows you to close the deal on the call** instead of letting the momentum die with a ""let me get back to you with a proposal.""

**The biggest mistake most people make is to NOT talk about pricing.**

Talking about pricing massively speeds up the sales process, because prospects can either accept your offer immediately, decline it, or try a delay tactic.

If they accept - then great!

If they decline or delay, you can ASK them why, and you’ll find out a lot about the objections they have about working with you.

# The warm-up

Spending 2-3 minutes on small talk shows you’re a relaxed, normal person, which helps the prospect relax, too.

* What to Say:
   * “I see you're based in Austin. I've heard great things about the food scene there.”
   * “I have to mention this, you picked the best Zoom background.”
   * “Glad we could connect before the weekend. Any exciting plans?”

Then, transition and set the frame. This is crucial for taking control.

* ""Awesome! Well, I’m excited to chat. Should we dive right in?"" (Wait for ""yes"")
* ""Great. So the way I usually run these calls is I'll start by asking a few questions to get a really clear picture of your business and what you're looking for. If it sounds like I can definitely help, I’ll explain how I work. Sound good?""

# Discovery

This is your ""doctor"" phase. Start broad and then go deep.

* **If they reached out to you:** ""So, to start, I’d love to hear what prompted you to book this call today? What’s going on in your business?""
* **If you reached out to them:** ""When I reached out, something in my message must have clicked. What was it that made you decide to take this call?""

Now, shut up and listen. Take notes. After their initial answer, dig deeper with your prepared, service-specific questions.

* **Pro-Tip:** If they give short, unhelpful answers, use this: **""Could you tell me a bit more about that?""**

# Their experience

Are you talking to a seasoned pro or a total beginner? The answer dictates how you'll pitch later on and what kind of questions to ask.

* ""Have you tackled this issue before? What worked or didn’t work?""
* ""Have you worked with another freelancer or agency on this? What was that like?""

This tells you what they value, what they hate, and what landmines to avoid. If they say their last designer was a ""terrible communicator,"" you know to highlight your communication process in your pitch.

On the other hand if they tell you they've had 20 freelancers on this and that they all sucked, you should probably run away.

# Defining success

This is where you move from their problems to their aspirations.

* ""Okay, let's fast forward 6 months. If we were to work together on this, what would need to have happened for you to feel like this was a huge success?""
* ""What would achieving \[their goal\] actually do for your business? Why is this a priority right now?""

When they answer this, they are literally selling themselves on the value of your service. Write down their exact words.

# Uncovering roadblocks

Why their problem still exists. This is the bridge to your pitch.

* ""So you’re looking to achieve \[their goal\]. What’s held you back from getting this done on your own so far?""
* ""Why do you think you haven't found the right person to help with this yet?""

Their answer here is pure gold. It gives you the exact angle for your pitch.

* If they say ""I don't have the time,"" your solution is about a hands-off, ""done-for-you"" process.
* If they say ""I don't have the expertise,"" your solution is about your deep knowledge and strategic guidance.

# The pitch

See how late this comes? You should only pitch after you fully understand their situation.

* **Ask for permission:** ""Okay, based on everything you've told me, I have a very clear picture of the situation. I'm confident I can help you achieve \[Their Goal\]. Would it be okay if I walk you through how I'd approach it?""
* **Frame it:** ""Great. So I specialize in helping \[businesses like them\] to \[achieve the exact goal they just told you\].""
* **Show proof:** ""For example, last quarter I worked with \[Similar Client\], who was struggling with \[Similar Problem\]. We implemented this process and they were able to \[Achieve Result\].""
* **Explain the process:** Walk them through the steps.
   * ""First, we’d start with a kickoff session to...""
   * ""Next, I’ll prepare xyz to...""
   * ""Finally, you’ll get...""

**IMPORTANT:** DO NOT REVEAL YOUR PRICING OR PACKAGES AT THIS POINT! Focus solely on the workflow and deliverables.

After you're done, ask them:

*  ""That’s the general overview. What questions do you have about that for me?""

When they run out of process questions, they will almost always ask the big one: ""So... how much does it cost?"" This is the moment you've been waiting for.

* ""The cost for the package I just described is $7,500.""

State your price clearly and confidently. Then, the most important part:

**BE SILENT.**

Do not justify it. Do not explain it. Do not say ""but we can be flexible."" The first person who talks, loses. Let them react. Their reaction tells you everything you need to know.

# Handling objections

An objection is not a ""no."" It's a request for more information or reassurance. Don't get defensive. You can't handle an objection if you don't know what they're thinking. So your first job is to figure out what they're trying to say.

**""That's more expensive than I was expecting""**

* ""I understand. Can I ask what you were budgeting for a project like this?"" OR ""Could you tell me a bit more about what makes it feel expensive?"" (This helps you understand if it's a value problem or a cash flow problem).

**""I need to think about it.""**

* ""That’s perfectly fine; most of my best clients take time to think. Just so I can understand, what specific part of it do you need to think about most?""

**""Why would I pay this much when I can get someone on Fiverr for $500?""**

* ""That's a fair question. You're right, there are definitely cheaper options out there, and for simple tasks, they can be great. The question is, are you looking to buy a task, or are you looking to buy a business outcome? A task-doer will do exactly what you say. I see my role as a strategic partner to help you achieve \[their goal\]. Which of those is more important to you right now?""

(I've got more objections and how to handle them in the google docs I'm linking below)

# The close

If they agree with your price and want to move forward, you're not done yet. You need to handle the final step professionally.

* Immediately explain the next steps. ""Great! Here’s what will happen next. I'm going to send over the contract and an invoice for the initial deposit. Once that's handled, I'll send you a link to book our kickoff call.""
* Don't just hang up after that! Spend 2-3 minutes returning to small talk. This calms their nerves, eases potential buyer's remorse, and reinforces that you're a human they're building a relationship with, not just a vendor who got their money.

# Extra info

I've put some extra objection handling examples, more info, more examples, etc. into a Google Doc which I'm linking in a comment below, to keep this post on point.  
  
This all takes practice to master so I also created a ChatGPT Monster prompt that will roleplay different levels of clients (easy to hard). I'm also including it at the bottom of the doc.

Entrepreneur,Significant_Flight70,I listened to my gut and turned down a $60K deal and am glad I did.,"Had a success story to share.

Last week, I turned down a $60k deal.

I'm a brand strategist and run a brand positioning agency. We work with 7-8 figure B2B service and manufacturing companies to reposition them in the market.

I had a lead who was the CEO of 2 businesses that fit my ideal customer profile. Small or no marketing team. Their product was already successful in the market. They had no idea how to reach new levels of revenue growth.

We planned to start with one business and use that increased revenue to fund the work for their second business.

Everything was going well until he said that he'd work with us only if we signed a revenue agreement. He didn't want to pay us until he made money.

A year ago, I might have said yes to this just for the money.

But the work we do is foundational to a business. Revamping their offer, nailing down their ICP, crafting messaging, updating their website, and developing a comprehensive marketing strategy. Now, some of our clients start generating revenue within a month of starting the strategy. But that's only if they start implementing right away.

It can sometimes take 2-3 months until they see new revenue, especially if they are slow to implement and don't want to pay us to implement for them.

My gut said RUN, so I did.

Three days later, a client signed a $50k deal and I landed a new lead that has a $50k potential.

From my point of view since I was 16 I understood that despite not having money at all I have what is much more important when it comes to building your name for yourself - time and energy. 

Building a relationship (etc family/marriage, not just being in one), career, kids, other responsibilities as well as possible health issues or just overall not being energetic as of now will stop and limit me much more than having no money, so I won't have an easier time than now to build and try.

Yeah obviously everyone knows this - but most just shrug it off or don't understand that it means you can easily push things to the limits - you don't need to play it safe or careful as much as others suggest to while you have limited amount of responsibilities. Test how far can your body work until its exhausted, don't try to play it safe with investments - try as much stuff as you can, you still dont have much to lose vs what you can gain as financially just as experience wise. 

This was my point of view since I was 16 and some years/months I was in a shithole but it's a very fun road when things pass by. I'm glad I was born into in some sort of way ''no wealth'' but not in a way of family not being able to afford food on the table but besides basic needs and a little bit over that, basically starting with no money at all, working as a waiter/side hustles to being where I am right now. And I have a huge way to go further so it's in some sort of way still a beginning for me despite have went through a bunch!

Hopefully someone finds this motivating a little bit or useful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1la8aky/dont_waste_your_20s_the_easiest_time_to_make_it/,13-06-2025

Entrepreneur,vidmakerpro,My side project accidentally makes more money than the business I spent 3 years building,"So this is kind of embarrassing and probably makes me sound pathetic.

I've been running a small marketing consultancy for 3 years. It barely pays my rent most months, but it's something. The problem is I'm terrible at my own marketing because I absolutely hate making videos.

Like, I will do literally ANYTHING to avoid making content. I've reorganized my entire office, done laundry, cleaned the bathroom - anything but sit down and make a video.

When I finally force myself to do it, it's torture. Write a script (2 hours of staring at a blank document), find visuales that don't suck (another hour scrolling through stock sites), record myself talking (10+ takes because I mess up every time), then edit it all together while questioning my life choices (2-3 hours minimum).

Total time: entire weekend shot for one 60-second video that maybe 30 people will see.

I kept telling myself I'd get better at it or hire someone, but I couldn't afford to hire anyone and after 2 years I was still spending Sundays having mental breakdowns over making 2 videos per month.

The breaking point was last December. I spent 8 hours on a Saturday making one video about ""email marketing tips."" Posted it everywhere. Got 12 views. Twelve. I literally cried.

That night I couldn't sleep thinking ""there HAS to be a better way to do this or I'm going to have to close my business.""

Started googling ""how to automate video creation"" and found some AI tools. Had zero coding experience but I was desperate enough to try anything.

Spent the next 3 months obsessively learning how to use AI to build stuff. ChatGPT became my coding teacher. I'd describe what I wanted and it would write code for me. When the code didn't work, I'd paste the error back and it would fix it.

Felt like having a patient programming tutor that never judged me for asking stupid questions.

After about 100 failed attempts, I finally got something working. You type ""email marketing tips"" and it spits out a complete video. Script, visuales, voiceover, everything. Takes 3 minutes.

First time I used it I made 8 videos in 30 minutes. I started crying again but happy tears this time.

My girlfriend saw me using it and said ""Holy shit, other people would pay for this."" I thought she was crazy but set up a simple website anyway. Put the price at $5/month because I figured if it's cheap enough, maybe a few people would try it.

Posted about it in some Facebook groups and Reddit. Expected maybe 5-10 signups if I was lucky.

6 months later I have 1,200 people paying $5/month. That's $6K/month which is literally double what my consulting business has ever made.

The insane part is I spend maybe 2 hours a week on it answering support emails. My consulting business that I've poured 3 years of my life into makes half as much and requires 40+ hours a week.

I built this thing because I was failing at my real business, and now it IS my real business.

AI basically saved my career. Without it, I would've had to get a job somewhere because I was about to run out of money.

Anyone else use AI to build something even though they can't code? Still feels like magic to me.

(It's called VidMakerPro if you're curious. I use it every single day because I still hate making videos the normal way)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1la9jl5/my_side_project_accidentally_makes_more_money/,13-06-2025

Entrepreneur,algorrr,How my journey as a solo entrepreneur inspired me to build a habit-tracking tool that keeps me focused every day,"Hey everyone,

Being a solopreneur is one of the most rewarding but challenging experiences I've faced. There are days full of excitement and hope- and others filled with doubt, distractions and burnout.

What helped me the most was learning to break down my big, overwhelming goals into tiny daily habits I could actually stick to. Consistency became my secret weapon, ut staying consistent wasn’t easy without some gentle nudges and reminders.

That’s why I started building a simple tool to help myself - and hopefully others - stay focused, motivated and on track by breaking goals into manageable chunks and sending encouraging reminders without pressure.

I’m still learning and improving it, but it’s already made a difference in how I approach my work and life.

Entrepreneur,migdinny,Is it even possible to have an original idea anymore?,"I've been discussing ideas with a few friends and we all share the same mindset: build something and *try, just try.*

But whenever we have an apparent genius idea, we get quickly shut down because we start searching on the internet about the competition and quickly realize there are multiple companies already offering the same product/service. 

It's just impossible to be original. Also, I get drained whenever that happens because the motivation to work on those ideas just vanishes. 

Is this a normal thing for a successful entrepreneur? Should we try anyways, even with competition? Should we just think about other different ideas? If we try and build something that already exists, how can we distinguish ourselves from the others?

Turns out, everything.

Those first 10 sales taught me more about product-market fit, positioning, trust-building, and my own emotional stamina than any course or mentor ever did.

Here’s what I wish I knew before chasing those first 10:

* People don’t buy “features.” They buy certainty. Certainty that you’ll solve their problem.
* No one cares how smart or hardworking you are, until they believe you understand them.
* Your offer isn’t clear enough. If someone has to ask “so what exactly do you do?”, they won’t buy.
* Follow-ups matter more than funnels. I’ve closed more with a personal message than a 10-email sequence.
* The fastest way to learn is to get rejected by real people with real money. It stings. But it sharpens you.

Once I hit those 10, the next 20 came faster. But I’ll never forget how brutal, confusing, and character-building that first stretch was.

I’ve been the first marketer on the ground, built go-to-market strategies from scratch, hired and led teams, and helped companies grow from zero traction to real revenue.

Most early-stage teams don’t need a full-time CMO. You need someone who has done this before. Someone who can bring structure, clarity, and a plan without burning your runway.

That’s why I now offer fractional CMO services designed specifically for lean, early-stage teams.

What you get:
👉🏼Audit of your current marketing systems
👉🏼Positioning and messaging that resonate with the right audience
👉🏼A go-to-market plan you can actually execute
👉🏼Early traction through focused channels and growth experiments
👉🏼Strategic input without the cost or commitment of a full-time hire
👉🏼Support with hiring, tools, and early marketing systems

Why I’m doing this
I’ve seen too many great products fail quietly because no one knew how to get them seen. I love being early. Helping founders cut through the noise, get their first wins, and start building momentum.

This is the work that energizes me. I’d rather help five scrappy founders move faster than sit in another C-suite meeting at a late-stage company.

I’m only taking on 5 clients right now so I can stay focused and hands-on with each one.

While Twitter is losing its mind over every new AI-powered app, the folks writing real checks are quietly backing stuff way less sexy.

Not another AI writing tool. Not a GPT wrapper

They're betting on the boring picks and shovels

Here’s what I’ve been seeing -

**1. Industrial/Manufacturing Tech -** These companies have massive budgets but their tech stack is 15 years old. They're running $100M operations on spreadsheets and WhatsApp groups. Every workflow is broken - procurement, quality control, maintenance scheduling, workforce management. They don't need digital transformation. They need basic shit that works. First SaaS company to speak their language instead of Silicon Valley buzzwords wins.

**2. Healthcare Operations -** Forget telemedicine and wellness apps. The money is in the back office - credential management, staff scheduling, supply chain, revenue cycle management. Healthcare spends more on admin than care delivery. These buyers write 7-figure checks for 10% efficiency gains. They move slow but pay forever once you're in.

**3. Financial Infrastructure -** Not fintech for consumers. The financial operations inside trucking companies, property management firms, franchise businesses. They're all held together with QuickBooks and prayer. These industries have complex financial needs - multi-entity accounting, specialized compliance, and weird payment flows. Generic solutions break immediately. Vertical-specific financial SaaS in these spaces faces zero competition.

# Stuff I immediately avoid -

* Tools trying to be everything for everyone
* Platforms with no clear why
* Founders who can’t explain ROI in one sentence
* Markets where Excel already works fine

# People don’t want 20 more tools, they want to kill 10 with one that actually works

So yeah you want outsized returns in SaaS, don’t chase hype start solving a boring, expensive problem in an old industry and make it hard to switch away from you

Entrepreneur,Realistts,What Makes a Good Small Business?,"Small businesses thrive on passion, a clear sense of purpose, resilience, and determination, driving them to overcome challenges and achieve success. Yet, this passion needs to be balanced with reality checks: a strong small business not only focuses on its mission but also excels in practical areas like financial management, efficient operations, and targeted marketing. A good small business blends inspiration with strategic action, ensuring both impact and sustainability.

While every business is different, there are several factors that can contribute to its success:

‍

* **Market Demand:** A great business idea solves a problem or meets a need relevant to your idea customer profile. Before starting, research your target market to ensure there’s sufficient demand for your product or service among your ideal customers.

* **Profitability:** While passion is important, a business must be profitable to be sustainable. Consider your pricing, cost structure, and potential profit margins before launching.

* **Scalability:** The ability to scale your business, grow your customer base, increase your offerings, or expand to new locations, is important for long-term success.

* **Skill Alignment:** The best business ideas often align with your existing skills and experience. This doesn’t mean you can’t learn new things, but starting with what you know gives you a head start.

* **Passion and Commitment:** Running a business requires dedication, resilience, and a genuine interest in what you’re doing. Choose something you’re passionate about to sustain your motivation.

* **Strong Business Plan:** A clear and well-researched business plan outlines your goals, target market, competition, and financial projections. It serves as a roadmap and helps in securing funding.

* **Customer Focus:** Understanding and prioritizing customer needs and feedback can lead to repeat business and positive word-of-mouth, which is indispensable for growth.

* **Financial Management:** Effective management of cash flow, expenses, and investments is vital. Many small businesses fail due to poor financial planning or mismanagement.

* **Adaptability:** The ability to pivot or adapt to changing market conditions or customer preferences can keep your business relevant and competitive.

* **Marketing and Sales Strategy:** A well-defined strategy for attracting and retaining customers is the backbone of long-term success.

Entrepreneur,akhilpanja,Built a Q&A Clustering System for Chatbots - Groups 300+ Customer Questions in Seconds! [P],"Hey everyone,

So I’ve been working on this interesting problem at work. We have clients who run different businesses (property management, restaurants, shops etc) and they all have hundreds of customer questions that their support teams answer daily. The challenge? How to organize these Q&As automatically so they can train their chatbots better.

The Problem:
Imagine you have 300+ questions like:

- “What’s the WiFi password?”
- “How do I reset the router?”
- “Internet not working”
- “Can’t connect to WiFi”

These are all basically about the same thing - internet issues. But going through hundreds of questions manually to group them? That’s a nightmare.

What I Built:

A Python system that uses OpenAI’s API to automatically understand and group similar questions. Here’s how it works:

1. Feed it an Excel file with questions and answers
1. It reads the content and understands the meaning (not just keywords)
1. Groups similar Q&As into main categories and sub-categories
1. Names each group based on what’s actually in them

The Cool Part:

It works for ANY business without changing the code. Same system works for:

- Property management → Groups into “WiFi Issues”, “Check-in Problems”, “Maintenance”
- Restaurants → Groups into “Menu Questions”, “Reservations”, “Dietary Restrictions”
- E-commerce → Groups into “Shipping”, “Returns”, “Payment Issues”

Here’s What My Results Look Like:

CLUSTERING RESULTS FOR PROPERTY MANAGEMENT (322 Q&As)

📁 Maintenance & Repair (76 Q&As)
├── Diagnostic Inquiry (31 Q&As)
├── Access Issues (19 Q&As)
└── Heating Issues (6 Q&As)

📁 WiFi & Network (31 Q&As)
├── WiFi Connectivity (27 Q&As)
└── Login Problems (4 Q&As)

📁 Check-in & Checkout (40 Q&As)
├── Early Check-in (17 Q&As)
└── Late Checkout (23 Q&As)

Quick Visualization of How It Distributes:

Main Cluster Distribution:
[====Maintenance====] 76 Q&As (23.6%)
[====Supplies=====] 69 Q&As (21.4%)
[==Checkout===] 40 Q&As (12.4%)
[==WiFi==] 31 Q&As (9.6%)
[=Others=] 106 Q&As (32.9%)

The Technical Bits (for those interested):

- Uses OpenAI’s embedding model (text-embedding-3-small)
- K-means clustering for grouping
- GPT-4o-mini for generating meaningful names
- Costs about $0.10-0.15 to process 300-400 Q&As

Why This Matters:

1. Chatbot training becomes super easy - just feed responses based on clusters
1. Support teams can create better FAQ sections
1. Identifies what customers ask about most
1. Works for any business in any language

Code Structure (simplified):

1. Load Excel file

data = load_excel(“customer_questions.xlsx”)

2. Create embeddings (understand meaning)

embeddings = openai.embed(questions + answers)

3. Group similar ones

clusters = kmeans.fit(embeddings)

4. Name them smartly

cluster_names = gpt4.generate_names(clusters)


Challenges I Faced:

- Sub-clusters were getting weird names initially (everything was named same as main cluster)
- Had to balance between too many clusters vs too few
- Making sure it works for ANY business type without hardcoding

Results:

- Processes 300+ Q&As in about 2 minutes
- 85-90% accurate grouping (based on manual checking)
- Saves hours of manual categorization

Currently testing this with different business types. The goal is to make it a plug-and-play solution where any business can just upload their Q&A data and get organized clusters ready for chatbot training.


For those asking about costs - OpenAI API costs roughly:

- Embeddings: ~$0.02 per 1000 Q&As
- GPT-4o-mini for naming: ~$0.10 per run
- Total: Less than $0.15 for organizing 300-400 Q&As

UPDATE: We’re Actually Offering This as a Service!

Since many of you are asking - yes, we can help you implement this for your business! Whether you’re running:

- Customer support teams drowning in repetitive questions
- E-commerce sites needing better FAQ organization
- Any business wanting to train chatbots with organized data

We can set this up for you. Just DM me or drop a comment if you want to discuss. We’ll need:

1. Your Q&A data in Excel/CSV format
1. About 30 mins to understand your specific needs
1. We’ll deliver organized clusters ready for your chatbot or support team

Already helped 3 businesses organize 1000+ Q&As each. Happy to share case studies if interested!

Entrepreneur,Brilliant-Purple-591,Do not exchange peace and harmony for entrepreneurship.,"While this headline may sound naive, there's an interesting theory that somebody had told me once. 

He said ""You know Kevin, every outcome that could happen right now, is happening at the same time, just in other realities. Every possible version of you lives in another reality and you can choose by yourself which one you want to live in"". 

While this theory is of course just a nice story (**😉)** it started to make me rethink: What if there's a possibility of living freedom midst all of this chaos? 

Then I jumped into Eckhart Tolle's and Viktor Frankls books and traveled to Sri Lanka and Indonesia, because my heart said so. I trusted fully and accepted its guidance.

Oh wonder, I discovered something much more important than my selfish economical desires. 

I forgot that life was never ment to be understood. It was ment to be felt. We spend so much time trying to figure everything out. Trying to fix, explain, solve, control.

But life is not a puzzle, it's a wave.

And we were never ment to carry the wave. We were ment to let it move through us. The joy, the fear, the heartbreak. The moments that didn't make sense until much later. 

We were never broken, we were becoming. I think the sadnes comes when we try to hold on to what's ment to pass. We grip the moment, the person, the feeling, hoping to freeze it in time.

But everything you ever loved was borrowed. 

And the beauty of it was never in the holding. It was in the being.

So, if you're hurting, don't rush to escape it. If you're lost, don't race to find direction. Feel it, all of it. Because this too is part of the dance. And if you listen closely enough, even your pain is trying to teach you

Entrepreneur,citationforge,I Built a Business Around the Least Sexy Part of SEO and It Pays My Bills Every Month,"Most people get excited about running ads, launching SaaS tools, or building brands.

I build backlinks.

Yep just old-school, manual, sometimes boring, link building.

No AI tools. No shortcuts. No big agency name. Just **me, a system, and clients who need results**.

It started small one gig, one client, one website. Now I’ve got recurring clients, steady income, and I don’t chase trends anymore. I didn’t need a big idea. I just needed something businesses can’t ignore: real SEO that drives calls and rankings.

Here’s what I’ve learned:

* Boring businesses = stable money.
* “Unscalable” tasks can become scalable with systems.
* Clients don’t care about tactics. They care about outcomes.

I’m not here to sell anything. Just wanted to say this:

You don’t need a groundbreaking idea to win.  
Sometimes, mastering one *“****unsexy****” skill* and being reliable beats chasing the next hot trend.

If you’re stuck figuring out what to do find something that sucks for others and build a service around it.

Entrepreneur,willkode,How to Spot the Lies in a Marketing Agency’s Pitch - from Someone Who Used to Work Inside One,"I used to run a marketing agency and before that I was inhouse for some amazing agencies - We pitched. We closed. We scaled.

But behind the scenes? I saw how it really works. The hidden truths. The vague promises. The overpriced retainers. Now, I help small businesses vet marketing agencies before they get burned.

If you've ever hired an agency and felt like they overpromised and underdelivered, you're not crazy. You're just not alone. 

If you are new to business and you're looking to hire your first marketing agency and don't have any experience read below, and remember this. Don't be afraid to fire and fire fast. Failure to deliver and explain the failure and what they learned so moving forward it doesn't happen again is the #1 red flag. 

When I ran my agency we set expectations, and if it looked like we wasn't going to reach them we would inform the client ahead of time and reset the expectation and how we are moving forward to make up the difference. We never let a monthly report be the first time they saw bad results. Even the best agencies fail, how they handle failure is what makes them great. Shit happens....

**Let’s fix that. - The 5 Biggest Mistakes Business Owners Make When Hiring an Agency**

Here’s what I’ve seen over and over again on both sides of the table.

**1. Falling for Charisma Instead of Clarity**

That agency founder with the slick pitch? Great speaker. Maybe even convincing.

But that doesn't mean their team can do the job. Often, the person closing the deal disappears after you sign.

Charisma closes deals. Clarity gets results.

**2. Not Defining What Success Looks Like**

Most business owners don’t ask the one question that matters most.

“What does a win look like for both of us?”

If you don’t define success, the agency can always claim they delivered. Even when they didn’t.

**3. Delaying the Budget Conversation**

Inside the agency world, this was the playbook. Build excitement, delay the price, anchor high.

From the other side, it’s clear what’s happening. Agencies that won’t talk money early are usually afraid you’ll walk away. And you probably should.

**4. Buying Vibes Instead of a Process**

You hear things like “We’ll grow your traffic” or “We’ll get you leads.”

But when you ask how, they get vague. No steps. No timeline. No accountability.

That’s not strategy. That’s theater.

# 5. Not Asking What’s Not Included

Scope creep is not a surprise. It’s often part of the plan.

If the agency can’t clearly tell you what they won’t be doing, that’s a red flag.

**Common Agency Lies and How to Call Them Out**

Here's what gets said in sales calls. And what you should ask instead.

|What They Say|Why It’s Sketchy|What You Should Ask|
|:-|:-|:-|
|“We’ve worked with companies like yours.”|But no details or proof.|“Can you walk me through one of those projects?”|
|“You’ll see results fast.”|Playing the urgency card.|“What’s a realistic timeline based on your experience?”|
|“We’ll handle everything.”|Until it’s out of scope.|“What’s not included in this engagement?”|
|“Let’s talk price after we scope it.”|Hiding the real numbers.|“Where do most clients start in terms of investment?”|

**What to Ask Instead**

If you want to avoid wasting money, you need to take control of the conversation. Ask:

* What happens if results don’t come right away?
* How do you define success in the first 30 or 90 days?
* What kind of clients do you say no to?
* Who is actually doing the work and what’s their experience?

If they fumble those answers, they’re not the right partner.

**You’re Not the One Being Interviewed**

If you have ever worked in agency sales you know the best way to land a deal is to interview the client and use their words against them to close them. When I ran my agency I handled sales calls like an internal marketing meeting, what's their goals, here are my ideas. If they like them we move forward. No sales tricks, just experience, confidence and value.

When I ran an agency, the best clients were the ones who asked smart, direct questions. They had clear goals, clear budgets, and clear expectations.

They didn’t waste time. They didn’t play games. And they didn’t get burned.

**Most Agencies Are Selling Tasks. You Need Outcomes.**

There’s a difference between hiring someone to do marketing tasks and hiring someone to deliver marketing outcomes.

If you just want ad creative or a few blog posts, almost anyone can help.

But if you're looking for growth, profit, and predictable results, you’re not buying content. You’re buying accountability.

Make sure the agency understands that. And make sure they’re ready to own it.

Entrepreneur,FreeMarketTrailBlaze,Accidentally stumbled into my first 7-figure business by helping a friend going through divorce,"
So I fucked up my grad school plans in the best possible way.

This was like 10 years ago. I was 25, living at home, trying to study for GMAT (graduate school entrance exam in the US) but getting zero focus. Family friend going through a nasty divorce offered to let me crash at his place to get away from distractions for the summer. 

Dude was getting absolutely destroyed financially. Lost half his shit in the divorce and was trying to keep his small business alive - medical interpreters for workers comp cases. $50k/month revenue but he was doing literally everything himself and burning out.

I felt bad for the guy so I offered to help with random stuff while I studied. Just basic admin work, right?

Wrong. Got completely hooked. Stopped studying entirely and dove into contracts, insurance reimbursements, cold calling law firms. The business stuff was way more interesting than test prep.

3 months later: $50k → $250k monthly revenue. I’d landed some solid partnerships that fixed their cash flow problems. My friend went from looking like death to actually sleeping again.

Then he drops this bomb right before I’m supposed to head back to school: “You’re better at running this than I am. Want to buy it? You could run it from anywhere.”

Me: “Bro I’m broke as fuck, I can’t buy a business”

Him: “I’ll finance it. Just pay me back from the revenue.”

I said yes in like 30 seconds. Never looked back.

Hit my first million 18 months later. Sold 5 years after that for mid-8 figures.

The main point: I had zero agenda going in. Wasn’t networking or trying to get anything. Just helping someone who’d been good to my family. Sometimes the best opportunities come when you’re not even looking for them.

 For anyone starting out (especially in the next 18 months w/the big boom of ai):

- Jump in where you can actually move the needle
- Work your ass off without expecting much back
- The money follows value, not the other way around

You need to figure out what you are really offering. Who is it for? Whether the market is already packed with similar things. 

That's why research is the first step. Dig into the market trends, get a feel from your niche, look at what competitors are doing, understand your audience, and try to picture an ideal customer. And that's just scratching the surface. 

  
Next comes the organic side of things. If you don't have some organic activity, don't step into Target. Targeting should support what's already working and help you to connect with a broader audience.

Over the last few months, 750 users have installed our Chrome extension (all inbound, no cold outreach). Up until now, I haven’t sent them any welcome emails or have any tech stack to send them mails.

Now, I want to start engaging these users via email and I’d love some advice from people who’ve been there and done that!

**My goals:**

* Start real conversations (not just pitch)
* Learn about their challenges with our product
* Get honest feedback on our extension
* Ideally convert at least 10-15 (but hoping for 30-40!) into paying users or booked calls

**A bit more context:**

* I want to create a sequence of emails (including follow-ups)
* I care about replies and real engagement, not just opens/clicks
* Prefer simple tools (free tools are welcome as well) - ideally Gmail-based, nothing too heavy or complex
* I’m aware of deliverability and compliance basics, but always open to tips!

**Here’s what I’d love your input on:**

1. **What’s the most effective 5-email sequence you’ve used for a similar list?** (What actually got replies? What flopped?)
2. **Which tools would you recommend for sending/tracking these emails?** I currently use mailsuite just to track mails and I have tried sending mails using mailmerge add on in sheet.
3. **How would you structure these emails for max replies and conversions?** (More feedback requests, value-add content, case studies, or something else?)
4. **Any deliverability or compliance tips for a first-timer with a warm list?**
5. **What’s a realistic conversion rate for this kind of campaign?**
6. For tools like GMass or Woodpecker: If someone replies, does the tool automatically stop sending them the rest of the sequence? How does that workflow look in practice?

If you’ve run a similar campaign, I’d love to hear your results, lessons learned, and any templates or frameworks you’re willing to share. Especially curious how you balanced value vs. pitching, and how you got users to actually reply.

Thanks so much for any advice or stories!

Entrepreneur,duygudulger,Good pitch decks don't answer all questions. They create them,"Hey guys! Want to explain a mindset mistake:

I've built 100+ pitch decks for startups, and I keep seeing the same mistake over and over.

Founders think their job is to explain everything. Like, EVERYTHING. (I saw a 52 slides pitch deck yesterday: deep, walking through every feature, every market assumption, every hiring plan for the next 3 years.)

But investors don't want explanations. Simply, they're looking for reasons to care.
Your deck has literally one job: get some responses from your cold emails or getting another meeting after the first one. That's it. 

You cannot close the deal with 1-2 emails or in the first meeting. Not explain your entire business model. Just make them think: ""Hmm, this might be interesting. Let's talk more.""

The best decks leave investors with good questions. Like ""Wait, how'd you land that partnership?"" or ""Tell me more about retention number.""

If they're not asking questions after your deck, it's probably not working.

Think breadcrumbs, not the whole loaf.

Don't explain all details your go-to-market: 
Show you're already getting customers

Don't detail every feature: 
Show one number that proves traction and tell why people love it

Don't write long sentences to convince: 
Show early demand signals

What to do right now:

1. Ask ""So what?"" on every slide.
If you can't explain why an investor would care, cut it.

2. Replace explanations with proof.
Not ""strong team"": ""CTO built Stripe's payments system""

3. End with cliffhangers.
""85% retention (industry avg: 12%)"" - now they know why it is important and want to know how.

4. Test it for quick memory.
Can someone explain your business after seeing your deck once?

Yes, pitch decks are million-dollar documents and pretty important but even the best ones can't close deals in day 1. 

Don't build your deck to convince. Build them to care and understand. 

Remember: Explanations end conversations. Questions start them.

If your pitch deck cannot get responses maybe you over-explain everything and kill the joy. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1l9qfbe/good_pitch_decks_dont_answer_all_questions_they/,12-06-2025

* What's something you wish these services offered but don't?
* What something that these services need to improve to give better ROI for the customers?

After I built a model, which is still in early stage but has some predictive value (about 70 percent accuracy), I also built an app so the users can get a prediction based on their inputs.

Build it, they'll come; not without distribution they won't.

Entrepreneur,Fluid-Age-9266,Mentality gap between owners and employees regarding AI promises,"I run a tech consulting practice focused on B2B businesses, mostly small to mid-sized companies. Over the past year, AI has become a central topic in nearly every engagement.

Owners are energized. They see the potential, faster workflows, lower costs...

But once we start implementation, there's a hard disconnect.

The teams are often underprepared, overextended, or simply not wired for this kind of shift. It's not resistance, it's a quiet disengagement.  
What I'm seeing more and more is a mentality lag. Owners want AI to boost their business. Employees are still catching up to yesterday's tools.

I'm starting to think the biggest barrier to AI in B2B isn't technical, it's cultural.

Curious if others in consulting or leadership roles are seeing the same thing. How are you managing the tension between executive ambition and team readiness? Are there models or approaches that have worked better than others?

Did any of you have a spouse or partner who wasn't fully on board with your vision for your business? Maybe they were skeptical, worried about the risk, or just preferred the stability of a traditional 9-5. How did you navigate that? Did their perspective change over time, or did you find ways to compromise and make it work?

Similarly, did you have family members who constantly told you to just stick to your ""real job"" or stick to a more conventional career path? How did you deal with that pressure or well-intentioned (but perhaps unhelpful) advice?

I'm sure many of us can relate to needing that external validation, and it can be tough when it doesn't come from the people we expect it from.

Entrepreneur,willkode,From Shy and Sleepless to Running My Own Agency. Here's What I Learned (for all those starting),"I used to be painfully shy. I still deal with insomnia and dyslexia. Life didn’t hand me a perfect starting point, but it did hand me a choice: let those things define me, or do something anyway.

I chose to build, not because I had all the answers, but because I got tired of waiting for someone else to figure it out for me.

I’m the middle child of seven, raised poor in a mobile home. I’ve made more mistakes than anyone I’ve ever met. But early on, I had the desire to be great. I wanted to be the best.

Now I know “being the best” is just an idea. It’s a perspective, not a reality. But that drive got me to where I am today, despite all the faults and failures.

Today, I’m a husband, a father (8 kids), and I run my own agency. I own a farm (it just happened lol) It wasn’t some overnight win. No shortcuts. No golden handshakes. Just a lot of quiet nights staring at the ceiling, wondering if I could really pull it off, and then waking up and doing the work anyway.

**Here’s something I’ve learned:** 

* Be honest. Share what you know without expecting anything in return. 
* Provide value, and you’ll become valuable.

I don’t know if the insomnia came first, or if it was all those nights staying up until 4 a.m. and waking up at 6 to go to work that caused it. Either way, insomnia is my superpower.

To the agency founders out there grinding:

* It’s not about being the smartest in the room.
* It’s about being the one who keeps showing up.
* The one who gets curious when others complain.
* The one who takes hits and keeps tweaking until something clicks.

I didn’t grow up with much, and I’m not some genius. But I’m proof that consistency beats confidence. Because confidence comes later. It follows momentum, and I have coming this October 28 years of it in this field.

If you’re building something right now and it feels like no one’s watching, good.  
That’s your training ground.  
That’s your foundation.

Keep your head down. Build. Learn. Repeat.

Entrepreneur,SuspiciousPrune4,Questions about working with co-packer (DTC juice startup),"So I’m trying to startup a juice company. It’ll be regional 2-day shipping only so the juice doesn’t spoil, so I’ll only target my advertising (social media) to my region.

I was initially planning on doing everything myself but the logistics and everything became overwhelming. Then I found out about copackers, which apparently can do everything for you - getting ingredients and bottles and labels, making the juice, bottling, HPP processing, keeping the inventory cold, then integrating with Shopify so they pick and pack/ship orders also. Then when stock gets low I would just authorize them to order more ingredients/bottles/labels etc.

Anyway I was wondering, is the MOQ huge to do something like this? I really just want to do a pilot run of maybe a few thousands units, so I won’t be able to afford it if the minimum is like tens of thousands of units.

And price wise, what should I expect to pay? I know there are a ton of variables here, but just for examples sake if I want them to make and ship 2,000 bottles.

Entrepreneur,Necessary-Tap5971,Why human+AI content has 3x better unit economics than pure AI,"Look, I get why everyone's freaking out about AI taking over creative jobs. But after spending the last year deep in this space, I think we're looking at it completely wrong.

The real power isn't in AI replacing humans - it's in the combination. Think about it like this: a drummer doesn't lose their creativity when they use a drum machine. They just get more tools to express their vision. Same thing's happening with content creation right now.

Recent data backs this up - LinkedIn reported that posts using AI assistance but maintaining human editing get 47% more engagement than pure AI content. Meanwhile, Jasper's 2024 survey found that 89% of successful content creators use AI tools, but 96% say human oversight is ""critical"" to their process.

I've been watching creators use AI tools, and the ones who succeed aren't the ones who just hit ""generate"" and publish whatever comes out. They're the ones who treat AI like a really smart intern - it can handle the heavy lifting, but the vision, the personality, the weird quirks that make content actually interesting? That's all human.

During my work on a podcast platform with AI-generated audio and AI hosts, I discovered something fascinating - listeners could detect fully synthetic content with 73% accuracy, even when they couldn't pinpoint exactly why something felt ""off."" But when humans wrote the scripts and just used AI for voice synthesis? Detection dropped to 31%.

The economics make sense too. Pure AI content is becoming a commodity. It's cheap, it's everywhere, and people are already getting tired of it. Content marketing platforms are reporting that pure AI articles have 65% lower engagement rates compared to human-written pieces. But human creativity enhanced by AI? That's where the value is. You get the efficiency of AI with the authenticity that only humans can provide.

I've noticed audiences are getting really good at sniffing out pure AI content. Google's latest algorithm updates have gotten 40% better at detecting and deprioritizing AI-generated content. They want the messy, imperfect, genuinely human stuff. AI should amplify that, not replace it.

The creators who'll win in the next few years aren't the ones fighting against AI or the ones relying entirely on it. They're the ones who figure out how to use it as a creative partner while keeping their unique voice front and center.

one night at like 2am i just started coding something to automate this stuff. didn't even think about it as a business, just wanted my life back lol

shipped the first version in maybe 10 days? super ugly but it worked. tried it on my own account first and holy shit it actually made my tweets better.

started reaching out to other twitter people, showing them before/after examples. charged $47/month which felt insane but people paid it??

**stuff that worked:**

* thread rewriter thing (takes your messy ideas and makes them sound good)
* smart replies that dont sound like robots
* dm templates for outreach
* post generator for when you're stuck

**stuff that was a waste of time:**

* fancy website (nobody cared)
* analytics dashboard (used it once)
* trying to be professional on landing page

then i got cocky. week 7 at like $3k mrr i decided to add instagram, linkedin, tiktok, email sequences... basically everything.

spent 3 weeks building features nobody wanted. users got confused. new signups stopped. people started canceling.

went from 8% churn to 30% in two weeks. almost quit.

had to strip everything back to just the twitter stuff. refunded some angry customers. focused on making the core features actually good instead of adding random shit.

now at $8k mrr and growing like 12% per month. users actually stick around now.

lessons:

* do one thing really well first
* listen to paying customers not random feature requests
* boring profitable beats cool and broke

still suck at paid ads and content marketing though. anyone scaled something like this past 10k without burning money on facebook ads? how'd you get your first 1000 customers?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1l8rqjr/hit_8k_mrr_with_a_twitter_tool_i_built_out_of/,11-06-2025

Entrepreneur,OmniscientShah11,done over 7 figures on walmart. ask me anything part 3. Walmart Marketplace Growth Tips + WFS Optimization,"What’s up Entrepreneurs,

It’s Shah back with part 3. My first post in this series got over a 100,000 views and an unimaginable level of outreach. Thanks for all the upvotes, clearly you guys like this so I’ll keep it going. wanted to drop some Walmart Marketplace wisdom that I’ve picked up from experience. Most people don’t even realize that Walmart is a solid place to sell, but it’s growing fast. It’s wide open if you know what you’re doing.

Every week (well, usually twice a week unless life gets in the way), I’ll be sharing raw, straight-to-the-point tips that have actually helped me grow my store past 7-figures in sales. No bs.

Today, I’m going over 3 mistakes I keep seeing new Walmart sellers make and trust me, these can really mess you up if you’re not paying attention.

🔷 Mistake #1: Not Building a Variation Strategy for Traffic Consolidation
New sellers often list multiple separate SKUs that should be variations (like different colors or sizes). This splits your traffic and review count across multiple listings, killing your ranking potential.
Pro tip: Combine related SKUs into one parent listing using Walmart’s variant group tool. This boosts clickthrough rates, funnels all reviews to one listing, and helps Walmart’s algorithm push your product higher in search.

🔷 Mistake #2: Neglecting Review Generation at Launch
Walmart heavily weighs early product reviews in ranking and Buy Box rotation. Sellers who don’t have a system to get those first 5 to 10 reviews quickly often flatline their listing potential.
Pro tip: Use programs like Walmart’s Review Accelerator (if eligible) or include insert cards that ask for feedback in a compliant way. Also, encourage reviews through post-purchase email flows if you’re driving outside traffic.

🔷 Mistake #3: Over-Reliance on Organic Rank Without an External Boost Plan
Walmart SEO is important, but relying solely on organic search takes time and you’ll likely get buried under competitors who are pumping outside traffic.
Pro tip: Create a launch sequence that includes Google Shopping feeds, TikTok UGC content, and influencer shoutouts pointing directly to your listing. Use UTM links and short-term discounts to juice conversions and rank faster.

Once again, I’ll try to post these detailed free tips every week (usually 2x a week). Let me know in the comments what topic I should break down next product research, shipping strategy, ad setup, or something else?

Entrepreneur,Efficient-Winter-790,What’s something the usual person wouldn’t think of when starting a business,I’m 21M. My whole life I was surrounded by businesses. My parents ran three small businesses at once when I was younger and then one finally took off after years. My whole life has been finance and business essentially. Recently I’ve been stuck on the idea of starting my own. I work nights full time now so I have my days open. I’ve been thinking about pressure washing driveways. Nothing crazy just extra money. I can’t stand how close I get on bills. Living on my own and away from all of my family. No real help so I have to do it all myself. (Obviously) I know that I can do more though. I want a future where I don’t have to struggle and my future wife doesn’t have to work and my future kids can live life happy and healthy. Maybe a life where I don’t have to work. I’m not where I want to be is what I’m saying. Getting hired into a different field without a college degree and any real skill set other than being a cook and some accounting background is very difficult. But in 5 years I’d like to not be a W-2 employee ever again. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1l8yd3u/whats_something_the_usual_person_wouldnt_think_of/,11-06-2025

Entrepreneur,TikiCruise,Solution/provider for european sim cards all in one ? 100+ physical sim cards and cheap ? With long term ownership,"Hey,

I have multiple use cases for european sim cards for my business ventures.

I thought some of you might operate in fields using that, I tried to find the right solution but still on it.

I personally live in europe czechia, and am able to get a sim card from ISP that i only have to pay like 2euros/dollars per year to mantain, it's very cheap, but it's a regular ISP where it's not ideal to like manage a big number of sim cards and fund them all easily, it's a manual tedious process.

I do want physical sim cards, that can do like normal sim card stuff, sms and phone, don't need internet. Need to be cheap. And I need a provider who can provide a diversity of european country sim cards.
Like Germany
Maybe france

Maybe greece
Maybe sweden or denmark

Like any country, doesn't need to have all, but a good variety yeah

So I need a variety maybe like 30 sim's per country, and I need to have it all in one interface, and it needs to be cheap, like 2 usd per sim annually would be dream, it can be slightly more expensive as I don't expect to be that cheap, I think i saw somewhere some service would offer a sim for 13 usd anually, for scale it's a bit expensive so maybe someone knows of a cheaper service ? I mean those numbers will be used occasionally so low usage, but i need to mantain them long term, that's why the 2usd/ year czech sim cards ate grear but i need for more countries and it's pain in the ass 

So I would pay a bit extra to have this but for more countries and a better integrated web interface to easily manage all.

I do want physical sim cards so if they could be shipped as I saw some businesses do that.

Anybody knows of a perfect business for that ? For european sim cards, low price to mantain, sms/call. Variety of countries, easy to manage ?


The alternative is for me to find a different ISP in each country, and do each country separetely, likely cheaper but massive pain in the ass and chaos to manage it all. It's enough for me to manage the czech numbers, let alone 6 more countries etc.

I might have like 150 sim's on top of the czechia ones, so paying 13 per sim would be expensive and a would lose point for me.

Entrepreneur,dedsekC137,"My AI Agent Vision: User-Owned Data, Business Insights, and Shared Value [I will not promote]","Hey guys,

So, I'm a software engineer. I've got this idea that I'm absolutely obsessed with, like, I want to spend every waking second building it. It's about creating truly personal Al agents for everyone. Think about it: instead of those annoying ""sell your data"" popups, what if your own Al agent (which knows you well, of course) could ask you while having some natural conversation, ""Hey, you wanted different spices at the local store. Should I tell the store's Al agent anonymously about your wish, maybe he'll start putting those spices from the next few days?"" And if you agree, that business gets valuable, consented, anonymized data about the product demands from not that one Personal AI Agent but from all the people that are using it. You, as a user of the app and on consent to share your data, will get a tiny cut of what they pay for that insight. Rest goes to the app.

The goal is to shift how data sharing works. It's about putting the user in full control, letting them earn from their data, and giving businesses the exact, ethical insights they need.

I've been looking into stuff like LangChain for the agent brains, maybe FlowiseAl for quick prototyping, and even AutoGen or CrewAI for when my personal agent talks to the business's agent.

So, for all you people out there, a few questions:

1. Is this idea even viable? Like, really?

2. Are there any open-source projects or paths that could super-speed up building an MVP for this specific ethical data-sharing core? I'm talking fast development, focusing on that user-to-business consent-based flow.

Entrepreneur,ferdbons,"Do not create an MVP, validate your idea first!!!","Many entrepreneurs dive straight into building, skipping the most crucial step: validating the idea.

What do I mean by that? From the moment your idea is just that, an idea, you need to validate it.

That means sharing it with your target audience as early as possible and collecting feedback right away.

Even if you don’t have anything concrete yet, if the problem is real and your idea addresses it, feedback will come.

This approach helps you quickly understand whether your idea makes sense or if it needs to be adjusted, or even completely rethought.

If you skip this step, you risk building something no one actually wants.

Entrepreneur,johnstevens456,"I used to emotionally bond with my employees, now I don’t even ask about their weekend.","For nearly a decade I couldn’t figure out how to build a team so I could step out of the day to day operations. Looking back I think the biggest tactic that I tried repeatedly was trying to bond with my first few employees. In my business there is a ton of time when it’s just you and one other person for hours and hours every night. Eventually they start sharing things about their lives and I would do the same. A lot of them respected me because I was a bit older or they wanted a business so they would open up and ask me for advice. 

I thought this was the move. I thought develop close friendships these people would become my inner circle as we grew the business. I thought that they would see my dream and how hard I work and it would inspire them to invest long term. 

Eventually they would emotionally manipulate me. Maybe not showing up on time or skipping critical tasks. They always developed a role of being my helper and not responsible for the job outcome. After enough time, they would completely flake out. I think the respected me so much and got so close that when they started slacking, it really effected their self esteem. They couldn’t handle dropping the ball and being called out repeatedly by someone too close, it was like my feedback was too heavy because it was tied to all of the other issues they were self conscious about. Like they felt like a failure to their soul and letting me down proves it. 

At some point, after not being able to handle the turnover and emotional swings of losing people I spent so much time in, I decided to not get to know my employees at all. I was strictly business. I became hardened and did not want to get to know them or them to get to know me, we are just here to work and go home. So I built the job in a way they could work solo and I trained them in a way that I could trust them. I let them know from day one, these jobs are your responsibility, you’re not helping me, you’re going to do them start to finish so you need tk take an interest in the tools and processes.

I gave them very clear instructions and made them feel like they could succeed by completing tasks correctly. I trained them slowly over time and didn’t get frustrated when they made simple mistakes. I also didn’t do their work for them to bail them out. 

Eventually this core shift enabled me to hire entry level janitors off the street. People who initially took the job because they were passing time until a better job came along. These people slowly developed and I made leaders out of them. My team grew to over 35 people, and I hadn’t met most of them. I didn’t even talk to most people during their entire employment at my company. My team hired, trained, and terminated people. Even if those people worked her for years, I never personally interacted with them. 

It might sound cold and distant but it’s not. I just allow them to do their job without any emotional weight from me. When they do well I promote and reward and I get to see these people develop over time and actually have a much bigger impact on their lives over a longer period. It’s from a distance but I know it’s making an impact because the first guy I raised up to a manager passed away a few months ago and his family has been calling me frequently and telling me how much the job meant to him and how proud they were to see him turn his life around in his final years.

We built an early prototype where founders pitch to an AI investor in realttime and get feedback, kind of like YC-style questions, scored responses, and suggestions to improve your pitch.

So now we’re thinking of evolving it into something more useful --a **Startup Fundability Score**.

The idea:

* You submit your pitchdeck and perform the pitch to ai-simulated investors
* We analyze it (based on clarity, team, traction, market, etc)
* You get a score out of 100 + feedback
* If the score is high, we forward it to real investors looking for vetted startups

So I started working with my dad (he has a medium sized media agency). I help out with generating leads, writing proposals, pitching etc but haven’t closed anything yet or made any money for the firm. I have tried cold calling alot and had some meetings but nothing panned out. 

Simultaneously, I have also been working on this offline social + event discovery app (my dad’s involved too and actually believes in this product). I learnt Figma to create the designs so we could save on UX designer, conducted user interviews, met some angels, now getting the branding and development done from an agency. Managing the development. I just think alot of people have tried and failed and there’s not much new things I can offer in the initial days. The market seems huge but offline socialising apps seem to always die down or have poor retention.

Like I have worked alot and been all over the place this last year. But it seems like not having even a product in a year or having a track with sales makes it seem like I should cut my losses and go back into a job (i got an offer from a venture debt fund). Maybe learn a few things and try something else in a few years. 

Any advice from your experience? Thanks :) 


Edit - Also, just for context purposes, I’m 25 right now. Have an MBA from an okay-ish college and 2 years of corporate experience. One part of me feels like I have more risk appetite right now than I will any other point in my life and other part of me feels like my peers are getting more CV points and making money and I’m missing out on that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1l87uya/its_been_a_year_since_i_quit_my_job_and_i_still/,10-06-2025
Entrepreneur,Diamond-Waterfall,What's a cold outreach/DM you'd actually respond to?,"Hello everyone,

So I am somewhat of a freelancer/entrepreneur, trying to grow my LinkedIn content and marketing business. I have a lot of experience in the field but still new to doing my own thing fully. Unfortunately, I put too many of my eggs in one basket and my biggest client is retiring, meaning I have to find 2-3 smaller clients to replace the lost income ASAP. I've exhausted all of my referrals and I'm now turning to an avenue I didn't want to turn to but have no choice to - cold LinkedIn DMs. I've had a few potential clients I'm interested in accept my connection request but I want to pitch myself to them in the right way. I don't believe in using AI tools when I'm already a talented writer, so want to craft the best possible message from the following questions:

1) Should I make it clear from the get-go that I have a service to sell or be more indirect?

2) What would make you as an entrepreneur actually respond to a message you receive?

3) Should my aim be to get them on a call as soon as possible? My ex worked in sales (and was VERY good at it) and he would always advise me to skip the small talk and get people to book in a call to keep their interest.

An entrepreneur friend told me not to write 'thank you for connecting' as it puts them on a pedestal. 

So I'm thinking of writing something like this:

Hello [name], I've noticed that you're trying to grow your presence on LinkedIn for [name of business] and I have a few ideas that could help. I would love to share if you're interested? Thank you.

P.S. If anyone here is looking for such services and is interested in finding out more, please let me know!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1l8l17o/whats_a_cold_outreachdm_youd_actually_respond_to/,11-06-2025
Entrepreneur,cryptonaresh,Building a chat-first AI social media management tool. Am I building something you want?,"Hey folks! 

I'm 11 days into building something called ZenShifu.

It’s a chat-first AI social media management tool to help creators, small & medium biz, and agencies.

AI assistant that lets you manage + schedule your social media just by chatting.

All automated...

like:

“schedule a post for IG tomorrow at 9am: new reel dropping 🎥🔥”



and, it’s done.

No dashboards, no clicking around

Just chat to manage like vibe coding.



Trying to make social media feel less like work and more like magic.

Would love your honest thoughts!



Would you use this? 

What would make it better?

Appreciate any feedback...

good or bad.

Entrepreneur,andreins1,"Officially, what are some ways to digitally escape the “9-5”","I thought I would get a post going as a way to dissect some of the scams out there.

For me, I work in digital content marketing, but my goal is to find some sort of digital means to escape. 

When you go on social media you see such an over saturation of “get rich” schemes all centred around freedom. But do they work? Return on investment? And who do we trust? 

Il list everything I can think of, ultimately I’m looking for something thats realistic, easy, scalable, and full of growth 

Ideas: 

Stocks
 PLR digits products
Dropshipping (all platforms) 
TikTok videos with a redirect to dropshipping store 
YouTube automation 
AI agents
Etc etc 

I know there’s a way to escape the matrix. The question is, what is it? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1l8kd4j/officially_what_are_some_ways_to_digitally_escape/,11-06-2025
Entrepreneur,kkatdare,Trying Outbound for the First Time: Suggestions?,"I run a B2B SaaS that lets businesses build their branded online community. So far; our customer acquisition is purely through SEO and social media posts on LinkedIn and Reddit.

Entrepreneur,citationforge,What helped me grow my SEO agency (without burning out or scaling too fast),"I started solo just me, a laptop, and a few local clients.

Now we’re a small team handling 25+ clients, mostly local SEO and link building.

Here’s what helped that I wish I knew earlier:

1. **Monthly Process > Monthly Results**: Clients understand results take time. What they really want is to see you’re consistent, organized, and proactive.
2. **Scope Everything**: Even with long-term clients, I stopped doing anything that wasn’t in scope. It saves stress, time, and weird conversations.
3. **Keep Client Reports Simple**: I used to send deep SEO audits. Now I send short summaries: “Here’s what we did, here’s what’s next.” That’s all most clients want.
4. **Don't Hire Fast**: I hired slow and only after the workload made me miss sleep. Still my best call.

Not claiming to be a big shot but if you're running or scaling an SEO agency, these helped me stay profitable and sane.

I want to book 30 minute calls with about 10-15 people to gather some feedback on some questions that I have.
